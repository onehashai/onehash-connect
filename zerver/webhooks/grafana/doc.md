   **Save contact point**.
1. Under **Notification policies** create a new policy (for example, a
   **New nested policy** of the **Default policy**), setting the
   **Matching label** as **Connect** = 1, and selecting the **Contact
   point** as the one created in the step above. Click on **Save
   policy**.
1. Under **Alert rules**, click on **Create alert rule**, where you
   will specify the conditions to fire the alert. Make sure you set
   the **Rule name**, and in the **Notifications** section add a label
   that matches the label created in the step above. Customize the
   **query and alert condition**, **alert evaluation behavior**, etc.
   and click on **Save rule**.
