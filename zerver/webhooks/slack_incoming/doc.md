This beta Connect integration supports for processing incoming webhook
messages written to work with Slack's [incoming webhook
API](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

Where possible, we prefer to create native Connect integrations that
make optimal use of Connect's topics and don't require translating
formatting, but this is a useful stopgap, especially for getting
messages from third-party vendors that only offer a Slack integration
(with no generic outgoing webhook API).

This integration, by its nature, involves a somewhat complex
translation between Slack's formatting system and Zulip's.  We
appreciate [feedback and bug reports](/help/contact-support) on any
cases where the resulting Zulip formatting is poor, so that we can
either improve the formatting or add an appropriate native integration.

See also the [Slack notifications](/integrations/doc/slack)
integration for mirroring content from a Slack instance into Zulip.
