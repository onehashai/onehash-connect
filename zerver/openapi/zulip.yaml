      summary: Fetch an API key (production)
      tags: ["authentication"]
      description: |
        This API endpoint is used by clients such as the Connect mobile and
        terminal apps to implement password-based authentication. Given the
        user's Connect login credentials, it returns a Connect API key that the client
        can use to make requests as the user.

        This endpoint is only useful for Connect servers/organizations with
        EmailAuthBackend or LDAPAuthBackend enabled.

        The Connect mobile apps also support SSO/social authentication (GitHub
        auth, Google auth, SAML, etc.) that does not use this endpoint. Instead,
        the mobile apps reuse the web login flow passing the `mobile_flow_otp` in
        a webview, and the credentials are returned to the app (encrypted) via a redirect
        to a `zulip://` URL.

        !!! warn ""

            **Note:** If you signed up using passwordless authentication and
            never had a password, you can [reset your password](/help/change-your-password).

        See the [API keys](/api/api-keys) documentation for more details
        on how to download an API key manually.

        In a [Connect development environment](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/overview.html),
        see also [the unauthenticated variant](/api/dev-fetch-api-key).

        For easy testing of mobile apps and other clients and against Connect
        development servers, we support fetching a Connect API key for any user
        on the development server without authentication (so that they can
        implement analogues of the one-click login process available for Connect
        development servers on the web).

            servers; for obvious security reasons it will always return an error

      description: |
        This endpoint allows you to receive new events from
        [a registered event queue](/api/register-queue).

        Long-lived clients should use the
        `event_queue_longpoll_timeout_seconds` property returned by
        `POST /register` as the client-side HTTP request timeout for
        calls to this endpoint. It is guaranteed to be higher than
        heartbeat frequency and should be respected by clients to
        avoid breaking when heartbeat frequency increases.

            **Note**: The parameters documented above are optional in the sense that
            even if you haven't registered a queue by explicitly requesting the
            `POST /register` endpoint, you could pass the parameters for
            [the `POST /register` endpoint](/api/register-queue) to this
            endpoint and a queue would be registered in the absence of a `queue_id`.

                                    Clients should generally handle an unknown property received here without
                                    crashing, since that will naturally happen when connecting to a Connect
                                    server running a new version that adds a new subscription property.

                                    **Changes**: As of Connect 6.0 (feature level 139), updates to the `is_muted`
                                    property or the deprecated `in_home_view` property will send two `subscription`
                                    update events, one for each property, to support clients fully migrating to
                                    use the `is_muted` property. Prior to this feature level, updates to either
                                    property only sent one event with the deprecated `in_home_view` property.

                                When a user subscribes to a stream, the current user will receive this
                                event only if they [have permission to see the stream's subscriber
                                list](/help/stream-permissions). When the current user gains permission
                                to see a given stream's subscriber list, they will receive this event
                                for the existing subscriptions to the stream.

                                **Changes**: Prior to Connect 8.0 (feature level 220), this event was
                                incorrectly not sent to guest users when subscribers to web-public
                                streams and subscribed public streams changed.

                                Prior to Connect 8.0 (feature level 205), this event was not sent when
                                a user gained access to a stream due to their [role
                                changing](/help/roles-and-permissions).

                                Prior to Connect 6.0 (feature level 134), this event was not sent when a
                                private stream was made public.

                                In Connect 4.0 (feature level 35), the singular `user_id` and `stream_id`
                                integers included in this event were replaced with plural `user_ids` and
                                `stream_ids` integer arrays.

                                In Connect 3.0 (feature level 19), the `stream_id` field was added to
                                identify the stream the user subscribed to, replacing the `name` field.

                                `sender_short_name` field was removed from message
                                objects.

                                    Clients should inspect the flags field rather than assuming that
                                    new messages are unread; [muted users](/api/mute-user), messages
                                    sent by the current user, and more subtle scenarios can result
                                    in a new message that the server has already marked as read for
                                    the user.

                                    **Changes**: In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 224), the `wildcard_mentioned` flag
                                    was deprecated in favor of the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` and `topic_wildcard_mentioned`
                                    flags. The `wildcard_mentioned` flag exists for backwards compatibility with
                                    older clients and equals `stream_wildcard_mentioned` || `topic_wildcard_mentioned`.
                                    Clients interacting with older servers should treat this field as an old name
                                    for `stream_wildcard_mentioned`. @topic mentions were not available prior to
                                    this feature level.

                                A simple event sent when the set of invitations changes.
                                This event is sent to organization administrators and the creator of
                                the changed invitation; this tells clients they need to refetch
                                data from `GET /invites` if they are displaying UI containing active
                                invitations.

                                **Changes**: Before Connect 8.0 (feature level 209), this event was
                                only sent to organization administrators.

                                Event sent to all users in a Connect organization when a new
                                user joins or when a guest user gains access to a user.
                                Processing this event is important to being able to display
                                basic details on other users given only their ID.

                                If the current user is a guest whose access to a newly created user
                                is limited by a `can_access_all_users_group` policy, and the event
                                queue was registered with the `user_list_incomplete` client
                                capability, then the event queue will not receive an event for such
                                a new user. If a newly created user is inaccessible to the current
                                user via such a policy, but the client lacks `user_list_incomplete`
                                client capability, then this event will be delivered to the queue,
                                with an "Unknown user" object with the usual format but placeholder
                                data whose only variable content is the user ID.

                                **Changes**: Before Connect 8.0 (feature level 232), the
                                `user_list_incomplete` client capability did not exist, and so all
                                clients whose access to a new user was prevented by
                                `can_access_all_users_group` policy would receive a fake "Unknown
                                user" event for such a user.

                                **Changes**: Starting with Connect 8.0 (feature level 228),
                                this event is also sent when a guest user gains access to
                                a user.

                                    One should use the standard Connect rendered_markdown CSS when
                                    displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax
                                    work correctly. And any client-side security logic for
                                    user-generated message content should be applied when displaying
                                    this HTML as though it were the body of a Connect message.

                                    Currently always true for public streams (i.e. `"invite_only": false` implies
                                    `"history_public_to_subscribers": true`), but clients should not make that
                                    assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

                                    Array of tuples, where each tuple describes a muted topic.
                                    The first element of the tuple is the stream name in which the topic
                                    has to be muted, the second element is the topic name to be muted
                                    and the third element is an integer UNIX timestamp representing

                                    array objects were 2-item tuples and did not include the timestamp
                                    information for when the topic was muted.

                                    such as for an [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews].

                                    **Changes**: As of Connect 5.0 (feature level 114), this field
                                    is present for all `update_message` events. Previously, this
                                    field was omitted for [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews]
                                    updates.
                                rendering_only:

                                    Whether the event only updates the rendered content of the message.

                                    This field should be used by clients to determine if the event
                                    only provides a rendering update to the message content,
                                    such as for an [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews].
                                    When `true`, the event does not reflect a user-generated edit
                                    and does not modify the message history.

                                    **Changes**: New in Connect 5.0 (feature level 114). Clients can
                                    correctly identify these rendering update event with earlier
                                    Connect versions by checking whether the `user_id` field was omitted.
                                message_id:
                                  type: integer

                                    The ID of the message which was edited or updated.

                                    This field should be used to apply content edits to the client's
                                    cached message history, or to apply rendered content updates.

                                    If the stream or topic was changed, the set of moved messages is
                                    encoded in the separate `message_ids` field, which is guaranteed
                                    to include `message_id`.
                                message_ids:
                                  type: array
                                  items:

                                    The list of IDs of messages to which any stream or topic changes
                                    encoded in this event should be applied.

                                    These messages are guaranteed to have all been previously sent
                                    to stream `stream_id` with topic `orig_subject`, and have been
                                    moved to `new_stream_id` with topic `subject` (if those fields
                                    are present in the event).

                                    Clients processing these events should update all cached message
                                    history associated with the moved messages (including adjusting
                                    `unread_msgs` data structures, where the client may not have the
                                    message itself in its history) to reflect the new stream and
                                    topic.

                                    Content changes should be applied only to the single message
                                    indicated by `message_id`.
                                flags:
                                  type: array

                                    message with ID `message_id` following the edit.

                                    A client application should compare these to the original flags
                                    to identify cases where a mention or alert word was added by the
                                    edit.

                                    **Changes**: In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 224), the `wildcard_mentioned` flag
                                    was deprecated in favor of the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` and `topic_wildcard_mentioned`
                                    flags. The `wildcard_mentioned` flag exists for backwards compatibility with
                                    older clients and equals `stream_wildcard_mentioned` || `topic_wildcard_mentioned`.
                                    Clients interacting with older servers should treat this field as an old name
                                    for `stream_wildcard_mentioned`. @topic mentions were not available prior to
                                    this feature level.

                                    are recommended to use the `stream_id` field instead.

                                    is present for all edits to a stream message. Previously, it

                                    topic and/or stream.

                                    The choice the editing user made about which messages should be
                                    affected by a stream/topic edit:

                                    - `"change_one"`: Just change the one indicated in `message_id`.
                                    - `"change_later"`: Change messages in the same topic that had
                                      been sent after this one.
                                    - `"change_all"`: Change all messages in that topic.

                                    This parameter should be used to decide whether to change
                                    navigation and compose box state in response to the edit. For
                                    example, if the user was previously in topic narrow, and the
                                    topic was edited with `"change_later"` or `"change_all"`, the Connect
                                    web app will automatically navigate to the new topic narrow.
                                    Similarly, a message being composed to the old topic should
                                    have its recipient changed to the new topic.

                                    This navigation makes it much more convenient to move content
                                    between topics without disruption or messages continuing
                                    to be sent to the pre-edit topic by accident.

                                Event sent to a user when [message flags][message-flags] are added
                                to messages.

                                This can reflect a direct user action, or can be the indirect
                                consequence of another action. Whatever the cause, if there's a change
                                in the set of message flags that the user has for a message, then an
                                `update_message_flags` event will be sent with the change. Note
                                that this applies when the user already had access to the message, and
                                continues to have access to it. When a message newly appears or
                                disappears, a [`message`][message-event] or
                                [`delete_message`][message-delete] event is sent instead.

                                Some examples of actions that trigger an `update_message_flags`
                                event:

                                - The `"starred"` flag is added when the user chooses to [star a
                                  message](/help/star-a-message).
                                - The `"read"` flag is added when the user marks messages as read by
                                  scrolling through them, or uses [Mark all messages as read][all-read]
                                  on a conversation.
                                - The `"read"` flag is added when the user [mutes](/help/mute-a-user) a
                                  message's sender.
                                - The `"read"` flag is added after the user unsubscribes from a stream,
                                  or messages are moved to a not-subscribed stream, provided the user
                                  can still access the messages at all. Note a
                                  [`delete_message`][message-delete] event is sent in the case where the
                                  user can no longer access the messages.

                                In some cases, a change in message flags that's caused by another change
                                may happen a short while after the original change, rather than
                                simultaneously. For example, when messages that were unread are moved to
                                a stream where the user is not subscribed, the resulting change in
                                message flags (and the corresponding `update_message_flags` event with
                                flag `"read"`) may happen later than the message move itself. The delay
                                in that example is typically at most a few hundred milliseconds and can
                                in rare cases be minutes or longer.

                                    When `true` for the `"read"` flag, then the `messages`
                                    array will be empty.

                                    predates subgroups being fully implemented.

                                Event sent to all users in a Connect organization when the
                                set of configured [linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier)
                                for the organization has changed.

                                Processing this event is important for doing Markdown local echo
                                correctly.

                                Clients will not receive this event unless the event queue is
                                registered with the client capability
                                `{"linkifier_url_template": true}`.
                                See [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue#parameter-client_capabilities)
                                for how client capabilities can be specified.

                                **Changes**: Before Connect 7.0 (feature level 176), the
                                `linkifier_url_template` client capability was not required. The
                                requirement was added because linkifiers were updated to contain
                                a URL template instead of a URL format string, which was not a
                                backwards-compatible change.

                                New in Connect 4.0 (feature level 54), replacing the deprecated
                                `realm_filters` event type.

                                    An array of tuples, where each tuple described a linkifier. The first
                                    element of the tuple was a string regex pattern which represented the
                                    pattern to be linkified on matching, for example `"#(?P<id>[123])"`.
                                    The second element was the URL format string that the pattern should be
                                    linkified with. A URL format string for the above example would be
                                    `"https://realm.com/my_realm_filter/%(id)s"`. And the third element

                                receive this event.

                                organization (realm) has changed.

                                Often individual settings are migrated from this format to
                                the [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict) event format when additional realm
                                settings are added whose values are coupled to each other
                                in some way. The specific values supported by this event
                                type are documented in the [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict)
                                documentation.

                                A correct client implementation should convert these
                                events into the corresponding [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict)
                                event and then process that.

                                Event sent to all users in a Connect organization when the
                                organization (realm) is deactivated. Its main purpose is to
                                flush active longpolling connections so clients can immediately
                                show the organization as deactivated.

                                Clients cannot rely on receiving this event, because they will
                                no longer be able to authenticate to the Connect API due to the
                                deactivation, and thus can miss it if they did not have an active
                                longpolling connection at the moment of deactivation.

                                Correct handling of realm deactivations requires that clients
                                parse authentication errors from GET /events; if that is done
                                correctly, the client can ignore this event type and rely on its
                                handling of the `GET /events` request it will do immediately
                                after processing this batch of events.

                                Specifically, this event is sent whenever the Tornado process
                                for the user is restarted; in particular, this will always happen
                                when the Connect server is upgraded.

                                Clients can use this event to know when they should get a new
                                event queue after a server upgrade. Clients doing so must implement
                                a random delay strategy to spread such restarts over 10 minutes or
                                more to avoid creating a synchronized thundering herd effect.

                                    changed, or when they know the specific feature level change
                                    is not relevant to the client (E.g. it just adds a new endpoint
                                    that the client doesn't use).

                                The more general of two event types that may be used when
                                sending an event to all users in a Connect organization when
                                the configuration of the organization (realm) has changed.

                                Unlike the simpler [realm/update](#realm-update) event format, this
                                event type supports multiple properties being changed in a
                                single event.

                                **Changes**: In Connect 7.0 (feature level 163), the realm setting
                                `email_address_visibility` was removed. It was replaced by a [user
                                setting](/api/update-settings#parameter-email_address_visibility) with
                                a [realm user default][user-defaults], with the encoding of different
                                values preserved. Clients can support all versions by supporting the
                                current API and treating every user as having the realm's
                                `email_address_visibility` value.

                                    in this event, but in fact it was only ever returned in the

                      #### BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID errors

                      This error occurs if the target event queue has been garbage collected.
                      A compliant client will handle this error by re-initializing itself
                      (e.g. a Connect web app browser window will reload in this case).

                      See [the /register endpoint docs](/api/register-queue) for details on how to
                      handle these correctly.

                      The following is the error response in such case:

      tags: ["messages"]
      description: |
        Marks all of the current user's unread messages as read.

        Because this endpoint marks messages as read in batches, it is possible
        for the request to time out after only marking some messages as read.
        When this happens, the `complete` boolean field in the success response
        will be `false`. Clients should repeat the request when handling such a
        response. If all messages were marked as read, then the success response
        will return `"complete": true`.

        **Changes**: Deprecated; clients should use the [update personal message
        flags for narrow](/api/update-message-flags-for-narrow) endpoint instead
        as this endpoint will be removed in a future release.

        Before Connect 8.0 (feature level 211), if the server's
        processing was interrupted by a timeout, but some messages were marked
        as read, then it would return `"result": "partially_completed"`, along
        with a `code` field for an error string, in the success response to
        indicate that there was a timeout and that the client should repeat the
        request.

        Before Connect 6.0 (feature level 153), this request did a single atomic
        operation, which could time out with 10,000s of unread messages to mark
        as read. As of this feature level, messages are marked as read in
        batches, starting with the newest messages, so that progress is made
        even if the request times out. And, instead of returning an error when
        the request times out and some messages have been marked as read, a
        success response with `"result": "partially_completed"` is returned.

        Fetch user's message history from a Connect server.

        This endpoint is the primary way to fetch a user's message history
        from a Connect server. It is useful both for Connect clients (e.g. the
        web, desktop, mobile, and terminal clients) as well as bots, API
        clients, backup scripts, etc.

        Note that a user's message history does not contain messages sent to
        streams before they [subscribe](/api/subscribe), and newly created
        bot users are not usually subscribed to any streams.

        By specifying a [narrow filter](/api/get-messages#parameter-narrow),
        you can use this endpoint to fetch the messages matching any search
        query that is supported by OneHash Connect's powerful full-text search backend.

        In either case, you specify an `anchor` message (or ask the server to
        calculate the first unread message for you and use that as the
        anchor), as well as a number of messages before and after the anchor
        message. The server returns those messages, sorted by message ID, as
        well as some metadata that makes it easy for a client to determine
        whether there are more messages matching the query that were not
        returned due to the `num_before` and `num_after` limits.

        We recommend setting `num_before` and `num_after` to no more than 1000, to
        avoid generating very large HTTP responses. A maximum of 5000 messages
        can be obtained per request; attempting to exceed this will result in an
        error.

            - `oldest`: The oldest message.
            - `first_unread`: The oldest unread message matching the
              query, if any; otherwise, the most recent message.

            **Changes**: String values are new in Connect 3.0 (feature level 1). The
            `first_unread` functionality was supported in Connect 2.1.x
            and older by not sending `anchor` and using `use_first_unread_anchor`.

            In Connect 2.1.x and older, `oldest` can be emulated with
            `"anchor": 0`, and `newest` with `"anchor": 10000000000000000`
            (that specific large value works around a bug in Connect
            2.1.x and older in the `found_newest` return value).

            The narrow where you want to fetch the messages from. See how to
            [construct a narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

            Note that many narrows, including all that lack a `stream`
            or `streams` operator, search the user's personal message
            history. See [searching shared
            history](/help/search-for-messages#searching-shared-history)
            for details.

            For example, if you would like to fetch messages from all public streams instead
            of only the user's message history, then a specific narrow for
            messages sent to all public streams can be used:
            `{"operator": "streams", "operand": "public"}`.

            Newly created bot users are not usually subscribed to any
            streams, so bots using this API should either be
            subscribed to appropriate streams or use a shared history
            search narrow with this endpoint.

            **Changes**: In Connect 7.0 (feature level 177), narrows gained support
            for three new filters related to direct messages: `is:dm`, `dm` and
            `dm-including`; replacing and deprecating `is:private`, `pm-with` and
            `group-pm-with` respectively.

            In Connect 2.1.0, added support for using user/stream IDs when
            constructing narrows for a message's sender, its stream and/or
            its recipient(s).

            The type of message to be sent.

            `"direct"` for a direct message and `"stream"` for a stream message.

            **Changes**: In Connect 7.0 (feature level 174), `"direct"` was added as
            the preferred way to request a direct message, deprecating the original
            `"private"`. While `"private"` is still supported for requesting direct
            messages, clients are encouraged to use to the modern convention with
            servers that support it, because support for `"private"` will eventually
            be removed.

            **Changes**: Support for using user/stream IDs was added in Connect 2.0.0.

            Clients should use the `max_topic_length` returned by the
            [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) endpoint to determine
            the maximum topic length.

            **Changes**: New in Connect 2.0.0. Previous Connect releases encoded
            this as `subject`, which is currently a deprecated alias.

            For clients supporting
            [local echo](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/sending-messages.html#local-echo),
            the [event queue](/api/register-queue)
            ID for the client. If passed, `local_id` is required. If the message is
            successfully sent, the server will include `local_id` in the `message` event
            that the client with this `queue_id` will receive notifying it of the new message
            via [`GET /events`](/api/get-events). This lets the client know unambiguously
            that it should replace the locally echoed message, rather than adding this new
            message (which would be correct if the user had sent the new message from another
            device).

          description: |
            For clients supporting local echo, a unique string-format identifier
            chosen freely by the client; the server will pass it back to the client without
            inspecting it, as described in the `queue_id` description.

                          If the message's sender had configured their [visibility policy settings](/help/mute-a-topic)
                          to potentially automatically follow or unmute topics when sending messages,
                          and one of these policies did in fact change the user's visibility policy
                          for the topic where this message was sent, the new value for that user's
                          visibility policy for the recipient topic.

                          Only present if the sender's visibility was in fact changed.

                          The value can be either [unmuted or followed](/api/update-user-topic#parameter-visibility_policy).

                          Clients will also be notified about the change in policy via a
                          `user_topic` event as usual. This field is intended to be used by clients
                          to explicitly inform the user when a topic's visibility policy was changed
                          automatically due to sending a message.

                          For example, the Zulip web application uses this field to decide whether
                          to display a warning or notice suggesting to unmute the topic after
                          sending a message to a muted stream. Such a notice would be confusing in
                          the event that the act of sending the message had already resulted in the
                          user automatically unmuting or following the topic in question.

                            **Changes**: In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 224), the `wildcard_mentioned` flag
                            was deprecated in favor of the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` and `topic_wildcard_mentioned`
                            flags. The `wildcard_mentioned` flag exists for backwards compatibility with
                            older clients and equals `stream_wildcard_mentioned` || `topic_wildcard_mentioned`.
                            Clients interacting with older servers should treat this field as an old name
                            for `stream_wildcard_mentioned`. @topic mentions were not available prior to
                            this feature level.

        Check whether a set of messages match a [narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

        For many common narrows (e.g. a topic), clients can write an efficient
        client-side check to determine whether a newly arrived message belongs
        in the view.

        This endpoint is designed to allow clients to handle more complex narrows

        implement this check.

        The format of the `match_subject` and `match_content` objects is designed
        to match those returned by the [`GET /messages`](/api/get-messages#response)
        endpoint, so that a client can splice these fields into a `message` object
        received from [`GET /events`](/api/get-events#message) and end up with an
        extended message object identical to how a [`GET /messages`](/api/get-messages)
        request for the current narrow would have returned the message.

                                  flags. The `wildcard_mentioned` flag exists for backwards compatibility with

        Edit/update the content, topic, or stream of a message.

        `{msg_id}` in the above URL should be replaced with the ID of the
        message you wish you update.

        You can [resolve topics](/help/resolve-a-topic) by editing the
        topic to `✔ {original_topic}`.

        See [configuring message editing][config-message-editing] for detailed
        documentation on when users are allowed to edit message content and
        [restricting moving messages][restrict-move-messages] for detailed
        documentation on when users are allowed to change a message's topic
        and/or stream.

        The relevant realm settings in the API that are related to the above
        linked documentation on when users are allowed to update messages are:

        - `allow_message_editing`
        - `edit_topic_policy`
        - `move_messages_between_streams_policy`
        - `message_content_edit_limit_seconds`
        - `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds`
        - `move_messages_between_streams_limit_seconds`

        More details about these realm settings can be found in the
        [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) response or in the documentation
        of the [`realm op: update_dict`](/api/get-events#realm-update_dict)
        event in [`GET /events`](/api/get-events).

        **Changes**: Prior to Connect 7.0 (feature level 172), anyone could add a
        topic to stream messages without a topic, regardless of the organization's
        [topic editing permissions](/help/restrict-moving-messages). As of this
        feature level, messages without topics have the same restrictions for
        topic edits as messages with topics.

        Before Connect 7.0 (feature level 172), by using the `change_all` value for
        the `propagate_mode` parameter, users could move messages after the
        organization's configured time limits for changing a message's topic or
        stream had passed. As of this feature level, the server will [return an
        error](/api/update-message#response) with `"code":
        "MOVE_MESSAGES_TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"` if users, other than organization
        administrators or moderators, try to move messages after these time
        limits have passed.

        Before Connect 7.0 (feature level 162), users who were not administrators or
        moderators could only edit topics if the target message was sent within the
        last 3 days. As of this feature level, that time limit is now controlled by
        the realm setting `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds`. Also at this
        feature level, a similar time limit for moving messages between streams was
        added, controlled by the realm setting
        `move_messages_between_streams_limit_seconds`. Previously, all users who

        restrictions when doing so.

        Before Connect 7.0 (feature level 159), editing streams and topics of messages
        was forbidden if the realm setting for `allow_message_editing` was `false`,
        regardless of an organization's configuration for the realm settings
        `edit_topic_policy` or `move_messages_between_streams_policy`.

        Before Connect 7.0 (feature level 159), message senders were allowed to edit
        the topic of their messages indefinitely.

                          A special failed JSON response (`"code": "MOVE_MESSAGES_TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"`)
                          for when the user has permission to move
                          the target message, but asked to move all messages in a topic
                          (`"propagate_mode": "change_all"`) and the user does not have permission
                          to move the entire topic.

                          This happens when the topic contains some messages that are older than an
                          applicable time limit for the requested topic move (see
                          `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds` and/or
                          `move_messages_between_streams_limit_seconds` in the
                          [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) response).

                          The error response contains data on which portion of this topic the user has
                          permission to move. `first_message_id_allowed_to_move` is the oldest message
                          ID in this topic that the user has permission to move.
                          There are `total_messages_in_topic` in the topic, but the user only has
                          permission to move the (most recent) `total_messages_allowed_to_move`
                          messages.

                          Clients should support this error code with
                          `"first_message_id_allowed_to_move": null` for forward compatibility
                          with future server versions that may use this error code with other
                          propagation modes where the user does not have permission to move any
                          messages, or where the server did not calculate the total message counts
                          noted above.

                          Clients can either only present the error to the user or, if
                          `first_message_id_allowed_to_move` is not `null`, prompt the user to adjust
                          their query with the above information.

                          If clients choose to present a prompt for this error code, they should
                          recommend the option of cancelling and (manually) asking a moderator to
                          move the entire topic, since that's often a better experience than
                          partially moving a topic. This API supports a client that wishes to allow
                          the user to repeat the request with a `change_later` propagation mode and
                          a target message ID of `first_message_id_allowed_to_move`, if the user
                          desires to move only the portion of the topic that they can.

                          Note that in a stream with [protected history](/help/stream-permissions),
                          the Connect security model requires that the above calculations only include
                          messages the acting user has access to. So in the rare case of a user
                          attempting to move a topic that started before the user joined a private
                          stream with protected history, this API endpoint might move only the portion
                          of a topic that they have access to, without this error or any confirmation
                          dialog.

            **Note**: This endpoint is limited to organization administrators
            who additionally have the `can_create_users` permission for the Connect
            organization. Connect Cloud users can request the `can_create_users`
            permission for a bot by contacting [Connect Cloud support][support]
            with an explanation for why it is needed. Self-hosted installations
            can toggle `can_create_users` on an account using the `manage.py

        This endpoint is most useful for embedding data about a user's
        presence status in other sites (e.g. an employee directory). Full
        Connect clients like mobile/desktop apps will want to use the [main
        presence endpoint](/api/get-presence), which returns data for all
        active users in the organization, instead.

        See [Connect's developer documentation][subsystems-presence]

                            contain two keys, `"website"` and `"aggregated"`, with identical data. The
                            server no longer stores which client submitted presence updates.

                            Previously, the `{client_name}` keys for these objects were the names of the
                            different clients where the user was logged in, for example `website` or
                            `ConnectDesktop`.

                      indicates whether the user is the only owner (`true`) or the only user
                      (`false`). The `entity` field in the error response is a internationalized
                      string that notes if the current user is the only organization owner or
                      the only user.

      description: |
        Change your [status](/help/status-and-availability).

        A request to this endpoint will only change the parameters passed.
        For example, passing just `status_text` requests a change in the status
        text, but will leave the status emoji unchanged.

        Clients that wish to set the user's status to a specific value should
        pass all supported parameters.

        **Changes**: In Connect 5.0 (feature level 86), added support for
        `emoji_name`, `emoji_code`, and `reaction_type` parameters.
      parameters:
        - name: status_text
          schema:
            type: string
          allowEmptyValue: true
          in: query
          description: |
            The text content of the status message. Sending the empty string
            will clear the user's status.

            **Note**: The limit on the size of the message is 60 characters.
          example: on vacation
          required: false
        - name: away
          deprecated: true
          schema:
            type: boolean
          in: query
          description: |
            Whether the user should be marked as "away".

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Connect 6.0 (feature level 148);
            starting with that feature level, `away` is a legacy way to
            access the user's `presence_enabled` setting, with
            `away = !presence_enabled`. To be removed in a future release.
          example: true
          required: false
        - name: emoji_name

            A string indicating the type of emoji. Each emoji `reaction_type`
            has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

            Must be one of the following values:

            - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
              dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
              that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

            - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
              the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

            - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Connect.
              In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
              "connect").

        Subscribe one or more users to one or more streams.

        If any of the specified streams do not exist, they are automatically
        created. The initial [stream settings](/api/update-stream) will be determined
        by the optional parameters, like `invite_only`, detailed below.

        Note that the ability to subscribe oneself and/or other users to a specified
        stream depends on the [stream's privacy settings](/help/stream-permissions).

        **Changes**: Before Connect 8.0 (feature level 208), if a user
        specified by the [`principals`][principals-param] parameter was
        a deactivated user, or did not exist, then an HTTP status code
        of 403 was returned with `code: "UNAUTHORIZED_PRINCIPAL"` in the
        error response. As of this feature level, an HTTP status code of
        400 is returned with `code: "BAD_REQUEST"` in the error response
        for these cases.

      description: |
        Unsubscribe yourself or other users from one or more streams.

        In addition to managing the current user's subscriptions, this
        endpoint can be used to remove other users from streams. This
        is possible in 3 situations:

        - Organization administrators can remove any user from any
          stream.
        - Users can remove a bot that they own from any stream that
          the user [can access](/help/stream-permissions).
        - Users can unsubscribe any user from a stream if they [have
          access](/help/stream-permissions) to the stream and are a
          member of the [user group](/api/get-user-groups) specified
          by the [`can_remove_subscribers_group`][can-remove-parameter]
          for the stream.

        **Changes**: Before Connect 8.0 (feature level 208), if a user
        specified by the [`principals`][principals-param] parameter was
        a deactivated user, or did not exist, then an HTTP status code
        of 403 was returned with `code: "UNAUTHORIZED_PRINCIPAL"` in the
        error response. As of this feature level, an HTTP status code of
        400 is returned with `code: "BAD_REQUEST"` in the error response
        for these cases.

        Before Connect 8.0 (feature level 197),
        the `can_remove_subscribers_group` setting
        was named `can_remove_subscribers_group_id`.

        Before Connect 7.0 (feature level 161), the
        `can_remove_subscribers_group_id` for all streams was always
        the system group for organization administrators.

        Before Connect 6.0 (feature level 145), users had no special
        privileges for managing bots that they own.

        [Mute a user](/help/mute-a-user) from the perspective of the requesting
        user. Messages sent by muted users will be automatically marked as read
        and hidden for the user who muted them.

        Muted users should be implemented by clients as follows:

        - The server will immediately mark all messages sent by the muted
          user as read. This will automatically clear any existing mobile
          push notifications related to the muted user.
        - The server will mark any new messages sent by the muted user as read
          for the requesting user's account, which prevents all email and mobile
          push notifications.
        - Clients should exclude muted users from presence lists or other UI
          for viewing or composing one-on-one direct messages. One-on-one direct
          messages sent by muted users should be hidden everywhere in the Connect UI.
        - Stream messages and group direct messages sent by the muted
          user should avoid displaying the content and name/avatar,
          but should display that N messages by a muted user were
          hidden (so that it is possible to interpret the messages by
          other users who are talking with the muted user).
        - Group direct message conversations including the muted user
          should display muted users as "Muted user", rather than
          showing their name, in lists of such conversations, along with using
          a blank grey avatar where avatars are displayed.
        - Administrative/settings UI elements for showing "All users that exist
          on this stream or realm", e.g. for organization
          administration or showing stream subscribers, should display
          the user's name as normal.

        in the [server's settings][1]. `MAX_EMOJI_FILE_SIZE_MIB` defaults

        notifications or what emoji set to use, not profile or
        identity settings that naturally should be different for each user).

        Note that this endpoint cannot, at present, be used to modify
        settings for existing users in any way.

        **Changes**: New in Connect 5.0 (feature level 96). If any parameters

            Whether to display the names of reacting users on a message.

            When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting users, rather than
            a count, for messages with few total reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on
            the space available for displaying reactions; the official web application
            displays names when 3 or fewer total reactions are present with this setting
            enabled.

                      enum:

                        One of the stream properties described below:

                        - `"color"`: The hex value of the user's display color for the stream.

                        - `"is_muted"`: Whether the stream is [muted](/help/mute-a-stream).<br>
                          **Changes**: As of Connect 6.0 (feature level 139), updating either
                          `"is_muted"` or `"in_home_view"` generates two [subscription update
                          events](/api/get-events#subscription-update), one for each property,
                          that are sent to clients. Prior to this feature level, updating either
                          property only generated a subscription update event for
                          `"in_home_view"`. <br>
                          **Changes**: Prior to Connect 2.1.0, this feature was represented
                          by the more confusingly named `"in_home_view"` (with the
                          opposite value: `in_home_view=!is_muted`); for
                          backwards-compatibility, modern Connect still accepts that property.

                        - `"pin_to_top"`: Whether to pin the stream at the top of the stream list.

                        - `"desktop_notifications"`: Whether to show desktop notifications
                          for all messages sent to the stream.

                        - `"audible_notifications"`: Whether to play a sound
                          notification for all messages sent to the stream.

                        - `"push_notifications"`: Whether to trigger a mobile push
                          notification for all messages sent to the stream.

                        - `"email_notifications"`: Whether to trigger an email
                          notification for all messages sent to the stream.

                        - `"wildcard_mentions_notify"`: Whether wildcard mentions trigger
                          notifications as though they were personal mentions in this stream.

    post:
      operationId: register-queue
      summary: Register an event queue
      tags: ["real_time_events"]
      description: |
        This powerful endpoint can be used to register a Connect "event queue"
        (subscribed to certain types of "events", or updates to the messages
        and other Connect data the current user has access to), as well as to
        fetch the current state of that data.

        (`register` also powers the `call_on_each_event` Python API, and is
        intended primarily for complex applications for which the more convenient
        `call_on_each_event` API is insufficient).

        This endpoint returns a `queue_id` and a `last_event_id`; these can be
        used in subsequent calls to the
        ["events" endpoint](/api/get-events) to request events from
        the Connect server using long-polling.

        The server will queue events for up to 10 minutes of inactivity.
        After 10 minutes, your event queue will be garbage-collected. The
        server will send `heartbeat` events every minute, which makes it easy
        to implement a robust client that does not miss events unless the
        client loses network connectivity with the Connect server for 10 minutes
        or longer.

        Once the server garbage-collects your event queue, the server will
        [return an error](/api/get-events#bad_event_queue_id-errors)
        with a code of `BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID` if you try to fetch events from
        the event queue. Your software will need to handle that error
        condition by re-initializing itself (e.g. this is what triggers your
        browser reloading the Connect web app when your laptop comes back online
        after being offline for more than 10 minutes).

        When prototyping with this API, we recommend first calling `register`
        with no `event_types` parameter to see all the available data from all
        supported event types. Before using your client in production, you
        should set appropriate `event_types` and `fetch_event_types` filters
        so that your client only requests the data it needs. A few minutes
        doing this often saves 90% of the total bandwidth and other resources
        consumed by a client using this API.

        See the [events system developer documentation][events-system-docs]
        if you need deeper details about how the Connect event queue system
        works, avoids clients needing to worry about large classes of
        potentially messy races, etc.

        **Changes**: Before Connect 7.0 (feature level 183), the
        `realm_community_topic_editing_limit_seconds` property
        was returned by the response. It was removed because it
        had not been in use since the realm setting
        `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds` was introduced
        in feature level 162.

        In Connect 7.0 (feature level 163), the realm setting
        `email_address_visibility` was removed. It was replaced by a [user
        setting](/api/update-settings#parameter-email_address_visibility) with
        a [realm user default][user-defaults], with the encoding of different
        values preserved. Clients can support all versions by supporting the
        current API and treating every user as having the realm's

            Whether the client supports computing gravatars URLs. If
            enabled, `avatar_url` will be included in the response only
            if there is a Connect avatar, and will be `null` for users who
            are using gravatar as their avatar. This option
            significantly reduces the compressed size of user data,
            since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not
            compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if
            clients can compute their own gravatars.

            The default value is `true` for authenticated requests and
            `false` for [unauthenticated
            requests](/help/public-access-option). Passing `true` in
            an unauthenticated request is an error.

            **Changes**: Before Connect 6.0 (feature level 149), this
            parameter was silently ignored and processed as though it
            were `false` in unauthenticated requests.

            Dictionary containing details on features the client supports that are
            relevant to the format of responses sent by the server.

            - `notification_settings_null`: Boolean for whether the
              client can handle the current API with `null` values for
              stream-level notification settings (which means the stream
              is not customized and should inherit the user's global
              notification settings for stream messages).
              <br />
              **Changes**: New in Connect 2.1.0. In earlier Connect releases,
              stream-level notification settings were simple booleans.

            - `bulk_message_deletion`: Boolean for whether the client's
              handler for the `delete_message` event type has been
              updated to process the new bulk format (with a
              `message_ids`, rather than a singleton `message_id`).
              Otherwise, the server will send `delete_message` events
              in a loop.
              <br />
              **Changes**: New in Connect 3.0 (feature level 13). This
              capability is for backwards-compatibility; it will be
              required in a future server release.

            - `user_avatar_url_field_optional`: Boolean for whether the
              client required avatar URLs for all users, or supports
              using `GET /avatar/{user_id}` to access user avatars. If the
              client has this capability, the server may skip sending a
              `avatar_url` field in the `realm_user` at its sole discretion
              to optimize network performance. This is an important optimization
              in organizations with 10,000s of users.
              <br />
              **Changes**: New in Connect 3.0 (feature level 18).

            - `stream_typing_notifications`: Boolean for whether the client
              supports stream typing notifications.
              <br />
              **Changes**: New in Connect 4.0 (feature level 58). This capability is
              for backwards-compatibility; it will be required in a
              future server release.

            - `user_settings_object`: Boolean for whether the client supports the modern
              `user_settings` event type. If false, the server will additionally send the
              legacy `update_global_notifications` and `update_display_settings` event
              types.
              <br />
              **Changes**: New in Connect 5.0 (feature level 89). This capability is for
              backwards-compatibility; it will be removed in a future server release.
              Because the feature level 89 API changes were merged together, clients can
              safely make a request with this client capability and also request all three
              event types (`user_settings`, `update_display_settings`,
              `update_global_notifications`), and get exactly one copy of settings data on
              any server version. Clients can then use the `zulip_feature_level` in the
              `/register` response or the presence/absence of a `user_settings` key to
              determine where to look for the data.

            - `linkifier_url_template`: Boolean for whether the client accepts
              [linkifiers][help-linkifiers] that use [RFC 6570][rfc6570] compliant
              URL templates for linkifying matches. If false or unset, then the
              `realm_linkifiers` array in the `/register` response will be empty
              if present, and no `realm_linkifiers` [events][events-linkifiers]
              will be sent to the client.
              <br />
              **Changes**: New in Connect 7.0 (feature level 176). This capability
              is for backwards-compatibility.

            - `user_list_incomplete`: Boolean for whether the client supports not having an
              incomplete user database. If true, then the `realm_users` array in the `register`
              response will not include data for inaccessible users and clients of guest users will
              not receive `realm_user op:add` events for newly created users that are not accessible
              to the current user. **Changes**: New in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 232). This
              capability is for backwards-compatibility.

                          to the server (and thus receive presence updates from the server).

                          It is important for presence implementations to use both this and
                          `server_presence_offline_threshold_seconds` correctly, so that a Connect
                          server can change these values to manage the trade-off between load and
                          freshness of presence data.

                          **Changes**: New in Connect 7.0 (feature level 164). Clients should use 60

                          requirement was added because linkifiers were updated to contain
                          a URL template instead of a URL format string, which was a not
                          backwards-compatible change.

                          **Changes**: Prior to Connect 7.0 (feature level 176), this was
                          an array of tuples, where each tuple described a linkifier. The first
                          element of the tuple was a string regex pattern which represented the
                          pattern to be linkified on matching, for example `"#(?P<id>[123])"`.
                          The second element was a URL format string that the pattern should be
                          linkified with. A URL format string for the above example would be
                          `"https://realm.com/my_realm_filter/%(id)s"`. And the third element
                          was the ID of the realm filter.

                          **Deprecated** in Connect 4.0 (feature level 54), replaced by the
                          `realm_linkifiers` key.

                                    a stream, we will send an empty array. API authors
                                    should use other data to determine whether users like
                                    guest users are forbidden to know the subscribers.

                          Important for clients containing UI where one can browse streams to subscribe

                          contain every unread message the user has received, but clients should support
                          users with even more unread messages (and not hardcode the number 50000).

                                access the user's `presence_enabled` setting, with
                                `away = !presence_enabled`. To be removed in a future release.

                                `reaction_type` has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

                                Must be one of the following values:

                                - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
                                  dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
                                  that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

                                - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
                                  the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

                                - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Connect.
                                  In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
                                  "zulip").

                          **Changes**: New in Connect 5.0 (feature level 89). Previously,
                          these settings appeared in the top-level object, where they are
                          available for clients without the `user_settings_object` client
                          capability for backwards-compatibility.

                              **Changes**: New in Connect 7.0 (feature level 175). Previously, there was no
                              way for the user to configure this behavior on the web, and the Connect web and
                              desktop apps behaved like the "Always" setting when marking messages as read.

                              Whether to display the names of reacting users on a message.

                              When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting
                              users, rather than a count, for messages with few total
                              reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on the space
                              available for displaying reactions; the official web
                              application displays names when 3 or fewer total reactions
                              are present with this setting enabled.

                              The value needs to be a standard language code that the Connect server has
                              translation data for; for example, `"en"` for English or `"de"` for German.

                                In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 170), added unmuted as a visibility
                                policy option.

                          A boolean which signifies whether the user has a zoom token and has thus completed
                          OAuth flow for the [Zoom integration](/help/start-a-call). Clients need
                          to know whether initiating Zoom OAuth is required before creating a Zoom call.

                          GIPHY's client-side SDKs needs this API key to use the GIPHY API.
                          GIPHY API keys are not secret (their main purpose appears to be
                          allowing GIPHY to block a problematic app). Please don't use our API
                          key for an app unrelated to Connect.

                          Developers of clients should also read the

                          before using this API key.

                          **Changes**: Added in Connect 4.0 (feature level 47).

                          servers should declare the `user_settings_object` client capability and
                          access the `user_settings` object instead.

                          The data at the given URL is a JSON object with one property, `code_to_names`.
                          The value of that property is a JSON object where each key is an
                          [emoji code](/api/add-reaction#parameter-emoji_code) for an available
                          Unicode emoji, and each value is the corresponding
                          [emoji names](/api/add-reaction#parameter-emoji_name) for this emoji,
                          with the canonical name for the emoji always appearing first.

                          The HTTP response at that URL will have appropriate HTTP caching headers, such
                          any HTTP implementation should get a cached version if emoji haven't changed
                          since the last request.

                          that clients respect this parameter, so that increases in the heartbeat frequency do not

                              When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting
                              users, rather than a count, for messages with few total
                              reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on the space
                              available for displaying reactions; the official web
                              application displays names when 3 or fewer total reactions
                              are present with this setting enabled.

                          A array of dictionaries where each entry describes a user
                          whose account has not been deactivated. Note that unlike

                          key, as all the users present in this array have active accounts.

                          If the current user is a guest whose access to users is limited by a
                          `can_access_all_users_group` policy, and the event queue was registered
                          with the `user_list_incomplete` client capability, then users that the
                          current user cannot access will not be included in this array. If the
                          current user's access to a user is restricted but the client lacks this
                          capability, then that inaccessible user will appear in the users array as
                          an "Unknown user" object with the usual format but placeholder data whose
                          only variable content is the user ID.

                          clients whose access to a new user was prevented by
                          `can_access_all_users_group` policy would receive a fake "Unknown
                          user" event for such users.

        Please note that not all of these attributes are guaranteed to appear in a
        response, for two reasons:

        * This endpoint has evolved over time, so responses from older Connect servers
          might be missing some keys (in which case a client should assume the
          appropriate default).
        * If a `/server_settings` request is made to the root domain of a
          multi-subdomain server, like the root domain of zulip.com, the settings
          that are realm-specific are not known and thus not provided.

        Fetch global settings for a Connect server.

        **Note:** this endpoint does not require any authentication at all, and you can use it to check:

        - If this is a Connect server, and if so, what version of Connect it's running.
        - What a Connect client (e.g. a mobile app or
          [zulip-terminal](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal/)) needs to
          know in order to display a login prompt for the server (e.g. what
          authentication methods are available).

                          a value of N means the server supports all API features introduced
                          before feature level N. This is designed to provide a simple way
                          for client apps to decide whether the server supports a given
                          feature or API change. See the [changelog](/api/changelog) for
                          details on what each feature level means.

        This endpoint is used to edit the current user's settings.

        **Changes**: Prior to Connect 5.0 (feature level 80), this
        endpoint only supported the `full_name`, `email`,
        `old_password`, and `new_password` parameters. Notification
        settings were managed by `PATCH /settings/notifications`, and
        all other settings by `PATCH /settings/display`.

        The feature level 80 migration to merge these endpoints did not
        change how request parameters are encoded. However, it did change
        the handling of any invalid parameters present in a request
        (see feature level 78 change below).

        The `/settings/display` and `/settings/notifications`
        endpoints are now deprecated aliases for this endpoint for
        backwards-compatibility, and will be removed once clients have
        migrated to use this endpoint.

        **Changes**: Prior to Connect 5.0 (feature level 78),
        the `/settings` endpoint indicated which parameters it had
        processed by including in the response object `"key": value`
        entries for values successfully changed by the request. That
        was replaced by the more ergonomic
        [`ignored_parameters_unsupported`][ignored-parameters] array.

        The `/settings/notifications` and `/settings/display` endpoints
        also had this behavior before they became aliases of `/settings`
        in Connect 5.0 (see feature level 80 change above).

        Before these changes, request parameters that were not supported
        (or were unchanged) were silently ignored.

      operationId: delete-topic
      summary: Delete a topic
      tags: ["streams"]
      description: |
        Delete all messages in a topic.

        Topics are a field on messages (not an independent data structure), so
        deleting all the messages in the topic deletes the topic from Connect.

        Because this endpoint deletes messages in batches, it is possible for
        the request to time out after only deleting some messages in the topic.
        When this happens, the `complete` boolean field in the success response
        will be `false`. Clients should repeat the request when handling such a
        response. If all messages in the topic were deleted, then the success
        response will return `"complete": true`.

        **Changes**: Before Connect 8.0 (feature level 211), if the server's
        processing was interrupted by a timeout, but some messages in the topic
        were deleted, then it would return `"result": "partially_completed"`,
        along with a `code` field for an error string, in the success response
        to indicate that there was a timeout and that the client should repeat
        the request.

        As of Connect 6.0 (feature level 154), instead of returning an error
        response when a request times out after successfully deleting some of
        the messages in the topic, a success response is returned with
        `"result": "partially_completed"` to indicate that some messages were
        deleted.

        Before Connect 6.0 (feature level 147), this request did a single atomic
        operation, which could time out for very large topics. As of this
        feature level, messages are deleted in batches, starting with the newest
        messages, so that progress is made even if the request times out and
        returns an error.

        Notify other users whether the current user is
        [typing a message][help-typing].

        Clients implementing Connect's typing notifications
        protocol should work as follows:

        - Send a request to this endpoint with `"op": "start"` when a user
          starts composing a message.
        - While the user continues to actively type or otherwise interact with
          the compose UI (e.g. interacting with the compose box emoji picker),
          send regular `"op": "start"` requests to this endpoint, using
          `server_typing_started_wait_period_milliseconds` in the
          [`POST /register`][api-register] response as the time interval
          between each request.
        - Send a request to this endpoint with `"op": "stop"` when a user
          has stopped using the compose UI for the time period indicated by
          `server_typing_stopped_wait_period_milliseconds` in the
          [`POST /register`][api-register] response or when a user
          cancels the compose action (if it had previously sent a "start"
          notification for that compose action).
        - Start displaying a visual typing indicator for a given conversation
          when a [`typing op:start`][start-typing] event is received
          from the server.
        - Continue displaying a visual typing indicator for the conversation
          until a [`typing op:stop`][stop-typing] event is received
          from the server or the time period indicated by
          `server_typing_started_expiry_period_milliseconds` in the
          [`POST /register`][api-register] response has passed without
          a new `typing "op": "start"` event for the conversation.

        This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications
        implementation to be stateless while being resilient as network failures
        will not result in a user being incorrectly displayed as perpetually
        typing.

        See the subsystems documentation on [typing indicators][typing-protocol-docs]
        for additional design details on Connect's typing notifications protocol.

        **Changes**: Clients shouldn't care about the APIs prior to Connect 8.0 (feature level 215)
        for stream typing notifications, as no client actually implemented
        the previous API for those.

        Support for displaying stream typing notifications was new
        in Connect 4.0 (feature level 58). Clients should indicate they support
        processing stream typing notifications via the `stream_typing_notifications`
        value in the `client_capabilities` parameter of the
        [`POST /register`][client-capabilities] endpoint.

            In Connect 7.0 (feature level 174), `"direct"` was added
            as the preferred way to indicate a direct message is being composed,
            becoming the default value for this parameter and deprecating the
            original `"private"`.

            **Changes**: In Connect 8.0 (feature level 215), stopped using this parameter
            for the `"stream"` type. Previously, in the case of the `"stream"` type, it
            accepted a single-element list containing the ID of the stream. A new parameter,
            `stream_id`, is now used for this.

            Support for typing notifications for stream messages
            is new in Connect 4.0 (feature level 58). Previously, typing
            notifications were only for direct messages.

            Before Connect 2.0.0, this parameter accepted only a JSON-encoded
            list of email addresses. Support for the email address-based format was
            removed in Connect 3.0 (feature level 11).

                                predates subgroups being fully implemented.

            before being automatically deleted by the [message retention
            policy](/help/message-retention-policy). There are two special values:

            - `null`, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization
              level setting.
            - `-1` encodes retaining messages in this stream forever.

            Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.

            Currently always true for public streams (i.e. `"invite_only": false` implies
            `"history_public_to_subscribers": true`), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The ID of the first message in the stream.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "more topics" widget that would suggest the stream
            has older history that can be accessed.

            Is `null` for streams with no message history.

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Connect 3.0 (feature level 1). Clients

            ID of the user group whose members are allowed to unsubscribe others

            **Changes**: Before Connect 8.0 (feature level 197),
            the `can_remove_subscribers_group` setting
            was named `can_remove_subscribers_group_id`.

            This is useful for clients to display the emoji in contexts
            where continuously animating it would be a bad user experience
            (E.g. because it would be distracting).

            **Changes**: New in Connect 5.0 (added as optional field in
            feature level 97 and then made mandatory, but nullable, in

            exactly one variable named `code`, which determines how the
            extracted code should be substituted in the playground URL.

            **Changes**: New in Connect 8.0 (feature level 196). This replaced the

            work correctly. And any client-side security logic for
            user-generated message content should be applied when displaying
            this HTML as though it were the body of a Connect message.

            to a given stream. Included only if `include_subscribers` is `true`.
        desktop_notifications:
          type: boolean
          nullable: true
          description: |
            A boolean specifying whether desktop notifications
            are enabled for the given stream.

            A `null` value means the value of this setting
            should be inherited from the user-level default
            setting, enable_stream_desktop_notifications, for
            this stream.
        email_notifications:
          type: boolean
          nullable: true
          description: |
            A boolean specifying whether email notifications
            are enabled for the given stream.

            A `null` value means the value of this setting

          nullable: true
          description: |
            A boolean specifying whether wildcard mentions
            trigger notifications as though they were personal
            mentions in this stream.

            A `null` value means the value of this setting
            should be inherited from the user-level default
            setting, wildcard_mentions_notify, for
            this stream.
        push_notifications:
          type: boolean
          nullable: true
          description: |
            A boolean specifying whether push notifications
            are enabled for the given stream.

            A `null` value means the value of this setting
            should be inherited from the user-level default
            setting, enable_stream_push_notifications, for
            this stream.

          type: boolean
          nullable: true
          description: |
            A boolean specifying whether audible notifications
            are enabled for the given stream.

            A `null` value means the value of this setting
            should be inherited from the user-level default
            setting, enable_stream_audible_notifications, for
            this stream.

          description: |
            A boolean specifying whether the given stream has been pinned
            to the top.
        is_muted:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the user has muted the stream. Muted streams do
            not count towards your total unread count and do not show up in
            `All messages` view (previously known as `Home` view).

            **Changes**: Prior to Connect 2.1.0, this feature was
            represented by the more confusingly named `in_home_view` (with the
            opposite value, `in_home_view=!is_muted`).
        in_home_view:
          type: boolean
          deprecated: true
          description: |
            Legacy property for if the given stream is muted, with inverted meaning.

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Connect 2.1.0. Clients should use `is_muted`
            where available.
        is_announcement_only:
          type: boolean
          deprecated: true
          description: |
            Whether only organization administrators can post to the stream.

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Connect 3.0 (feature level 1). Clients
            should use `stream_post_policy` instead.
        is_web_public:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the stream has been configured to allow unauthenticated
            access to its message history from the web.
        color:
          type: string
          description: |
            The user's personal color for the stream.
        stream_post_policy:
          type: integer
          description: |
            [Policy][permission-level] for which users can post messages to the stream.

            - 1 = Any user can post.
            - 2 = Only administrators can post.
            - 3 = Only [full members][calc-full-member] can post.
            - 4 = Only moderators can post.

            **Changes**: New in Connect 3.0 (feature level 1), replacing the previous
            `is_announcement_only` boolean.

        message_retention_days:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            Number of days that messages sent to this stream will be stored
            before being automatically deleted by the [message retention
            policy](/help/message-retention-policy). There are two special values:

            - `null`, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization
              level setting.
            - `-1` encodes retaining messages in this stream forever.

            **Changes**: New in Connect 3.0 (feature level 17).
        history_public_to_subscribers:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.

            Currently always true for public streams (i.e. `"invite_only": false` implies
            `"history_public_to_subscribers": true`), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.
        first_message_id:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The ID of the first message in the stream.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "more topics" widget that would suggest the stream
            has older history that can be accessed.

            Is `null` for streams with no message history.
        stream_weekly_traffic:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The average number of messages sent to the stream per week, as
            estimated based on recent weeks, rounded to the nearest integer.

            If `null`, the stream was recently created and there is
            insufficient data to estimate the average traffic.
        can_remove_subscribers_group:
          type: integer
          description: |
            ID of the user group whose members are allowed to unsubscribe others
            from the stream.

            **Changes**: Before Connect 8.0 (feature level 197),
            the `can_remove_subscribers_group` setting
            was named `can_remove_subscribers_group_id`.

            New in Connect 6.0 (feature level 142).

                [events API](/api/get-events) has a slightly different
                `user` dictionary format, with the user ID field
                called `user_id` instead.

                **Changes**: Deprecated and to be removed in a future release
                once core clients have migrated to use the adjacent `user_id`
                field, which was introduced in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 2).
                Clients supporting older Zulip server versions should use

              dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
              that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

            - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
              the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

            - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Connect.
              In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.

            If `null`, then the sender has not uploaded an avatar in Connect,

            **Changes**: Before Connect 7.0 (feature level 163), access to a

          description: |
            The user's real email address. This value will be `null` if you cannot
            access user's real email address. For bot users, this field is always
            set to the real email of the bot, because bot users always have
            `email_address_visibility` set to everyone.

            **Changes**: Prior to Connect 7.0 (feature level 163), this field was
            present only when `email_address_visibility` was restricted and you had
            access to the user's real email. As of this feature level, this field
            is always present, including the case when `email_address_visibility`
            is set to everyone (and therefore not restricted).

            is the user ID of the bot's owner (usually, whoever created the bot).

            Will be `null` for legacy bots that do not have an owner.

            **Changes**: New in Connect 3.0 (feature level 1). In previous
            versions, there was a `bot_owner` field containing the email
            address of the bot's owner.

            Will be `null` if the `client_gravatar`
            query parameter was set to `true`, the current user has access to
            this user's real email address, and this user's avatar is hosted by
            the Gravatar provider (i.e. this user has never uploaded an avatar).

            **Changes**: Before Connect 7.0 (feature level 163), access to a
            user's real email address was a realm-level setting. As of this
            feature level, `email_address_visibility` is a user setting.

            In Connect 3.0 (feature level 18), if the client has the
            `user_avatar_url_field_optional` capability, this will be missing at
            the server's sole discretion.

            ## Rate limit exceeded

            The `retry-after` parameter in the response indicates how many seconds
            the client must wait before making additional requests.

            Connect sets a few [HTTP response headers][rate-limit-headers]
            to help with preventing rate limit errors.

            **Changes**: The `code` field was not present in rate
            limit errors before Connect 4.0 (feature level 36).

            A typical failed JSON response for when a rate limit is exceeded:

  parameters:
    Event_types:
      name: event_types
      in: query
      description: |
        A JSON-encoded array indicating which types of events you're interested
        in. Values that you might find useful include:

        - **message** (messages)
        - **subscription** (changes in your subscriptions)
        - **realm_user** (changes to users in the organization and
          their properties, such as their name).

        If you do not specify this parameter, you will receive all
        events, and have to filter out the events not relevant to
        your client in your client code. For most applications, one
        is only interested in messages, so one specifies:
        `"event_types": ["message"]`

        Event types not supported by the server are ignored, in order to simplify
        the implementation of client apps that support multiple server versions.

      required: false
    Narrow:
      name: narrow
      in: query
      description: |
        A JSON-encoded array of arrays of length 2 indicating the
        [narrow filter(s)](/api/construct-narrow) for which you'd
        like to receive events for.

        For example, to receive events for direct messages (including
        group direct messages) received by the user, one can use
        `"narrow": [["is", "dm"]]`.

        Unlike the API for [fetching messages](/api/get-messages),
        this narrow parameter is simply a filter on messages that the
        user receives through their stream subscriptions (or because
        they are a recipient of a direct message).

        This means that a client that requests a `narrow` filter of
        `[["stream", "Denmark"]]` will receive events for new messages
        sent to that stream while the user is subscribed to that
        stream. The client will not receive any message events at all
        if the user is not subscribed to `"Denmark"`.

        Newly created bot users are not usually subscribed to any
        streams, so bots using this API need to be
        [subscribed](/api/subscribe) to any streams whose messages
        you'd like them to process using this endpoint.

        See the `all_public_streams` parameter for how to process all
        public stream messages in an organization.

        Defaults to `[]`.

        **Changes**: In Connect 7.0 (feature level 177), narrows gained support
        for three new filters related to direct messages: `is:dm`, `dm` and
        `dm-including`; replacing and deprecating `is:private`, `pm-with` and
        `group-pm-with` respectively.

        are using gravatar as their avatar. This option
        significantly reduces the compressed size of user data,
        since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not
        compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if
        clients can compute their own gravatars.

      in: query
      description: |
        A string indicating the type of emoji. Each emoji `reaction_type`
        has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

        If an API client is adding/removing a vote on an existing reaction,
        it should pass this parameter using the value the server provided
        for the existing reaction for specificity. Supported values:

        - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
          dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
          that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

        - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
          the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

        - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Connect.
          In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
          "connect").

        **Changes**: In Connect 3.0 (feature level 2), this parameter became
        optional for [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji);
        previously, this endpoint assumed `unicode_emoji` if this
        parameter was not specified.

      description: |
        A unique identifier, defining the specific emoji codepoint requested,

        For most API clients, you won't need this, but it's important
        for Connect apps to handle rare corner cases when
        adding/removing votes on an emoji reaction added previously by
        another user.

        If the existing reaction was added when the Connect server was
        using a previous version of the emoji data mapping between
        Unicode codepoints and human-readable names, sending the
        `emoji_code` in the data for the original reaction allows the
        Connect server to correctly interpret your upvote as an upvote
        rather than a reaction with a "different" emoji.
