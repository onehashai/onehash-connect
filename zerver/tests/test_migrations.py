# Important note: These tests are very expensive, and details of
# Django's database transaction model mean it does not super work to
# have a lot of migrations tested in this file at once; so we usually
# delete the old migration tests when adding a new one, so this file
# always has a single migration test in it as an example.
#
# The error you get with multiple similar tests doing migrations on
# the same table is this (table name may vary):
#
#   django.db.utils.OperationalError: cannot ALTER TABLE
#   "zerver_subscription" because it has pending trigger events
