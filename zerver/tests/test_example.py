        #
        # To do that we'll have to wait for the time limit to pass which is
        # 5 minutes here. Easy, use time.sleep() but mind that it slows down the
        # test to a great extent which isn't good. This is when mocking comes to rescue.
        # We can check what the original code does to determine whether the time limit
        # exceeded and mock that here such that the code runs as if the time limit
        # exceeded without actually waiting for that long!
        #
        # In this case, it is timezone_now, an alias to django.utils.timezone.now,
        # to which the difference with message-sent-time is checked. So, we want
        # that timezone_now() call to return `datetime` object representing time
        # that is beyond the limit.
        #
        # Notice how mock.patch() is used here to do exactly the above mentioned.
        # mock.patch() here makes any calls to `timezone_now` in `zerver.actions.message_edit`
        # to return the value passed to `return_value` in the its context.
        # You can also use mock.patch() as a decorator depending on the
        # requirements. Read more at the documentation link provided above.
