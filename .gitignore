# Quick format and style primer:
#
#  * If a pattern is meant only for a specific location, it should have a
#    leading slash, like `/staticfiles.json`.
#    * In principle any non-trailing slash (like `zproject/dev-secrets.conf`)
#      will do, but this makes a confusing pattern.  Adding a leading slash
#      is clearer.
#
#  * Patterns like `.vscode/` without slashes, or with only a trailing slash,
#    match in any subdirectory.
#
#  * Subdirectories with several internal things to ignore get their own
#    `.gitignore` files.
#
#  * Comments must be on their own line.  (Otherwise they don't work.)
#
# See `git help ignore` for details on the format.
