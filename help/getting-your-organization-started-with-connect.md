# Setting up your organization

Welcome to OneHash Connect! This page will guide you through trying out OneHash Connect,
migrating your organization from other team chat tools (if needed),
getting everything set up, and inviting others to join.

If you are joining an existing organization, we recommend checking out
our guide to [Getting started with Connect][getting-started].

[getting-started]: /help/getting-started-with-connect

If you encounter any problems as you're getting started, please drop
by our [friendly development community](/development-community/) and let
us know!

## Choosing between OneHash Connect Cloud and self-hosting

Whether [signing up for Connect Cloud](/new/) or [self-hosting
Connect](/self-hosting/) is the right choice for you depends on the
needs of your organization.

If you arenâ€™t sure what you need, our high quality export and import
tools ([cloud][export-cloud], [self-hosted][export-self-hosted])
ensure you can always move from our hosting to yours (and back).
