mentions](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications#wildcard-mentions) that affect a
large number of users. In particular, an organization can restrict who is
allowed to use `@all` (and, equivalently, `@everyone` and `@stream`) in streams
with more than 15 subscribers, and `@topic` in topics with more than 15
participants.
