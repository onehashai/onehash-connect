# Add or remove users from a stream

By default, anyone (other than guests) subscribed to a stream can add
users to that stream. Additionally, anyone (other than guests) can add
users to a public stream, whether or not they are subscribed to the
stream. Anyone can always [unsubscribe themselves from a stream](/help/unsubscribe-from-a-stream).

Organization administrators can also unsubscribe *other* users from any stream,
including streams the admin is not subscribed to. They can also configure which
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions) have access to [add other users to a
stream][add-users] or [remove other users from a stream][remove-users].

[remove-users]: /help/configure-who-can-invite-to-streams#configure-who-can-remove-users
