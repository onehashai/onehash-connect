# Link to a message or conversation

OneHash Connect makes it easy to share links to messages, topics, and streams. You can
link from one OneHash Connect [conversation](/help/recent-conversations) to another, or
share links to OneHash Connect conversations in issue trackers, emails, or other external
tools.

## Link to a stream or topic within OneHash Connect

OneHash Connect automatically creates links to streams and topics in messages you send.

The easiest way to link to a stream or topic is:

{start_tabs}

1. Type `#` followed by the one or more letters of the stream name.

1. Choose the desired stream from the auto-complete menu. The link will be
   automatically formatted for you.

1. If linking to a topic, type `>` after selecting a stream as
   described above, followed by one or more letters of the topic name.

1. Choose the desired topic from the auto-complete menu. The link will be
   automatically formatted for you.

{end_tabs}

Alternatively, it is possible to manually format stream and topic links:

```
Stream: #**stream name**
Topic: #**stream name>topic name**
```

## Link to OneHash Connect from anywhere

All URLs in OneHash Connect are designed to be shareable.  Copying the URL from
the browser's address bar will work for all views, including searches.

### Get a link to a specific message

This copies to your clipboard a permanent link to the message,
displayed in its thread (i.e. topic view for messages in a stream).
Viewing a topic via a message link will never mark messages as read.

These links will still work even when the message is
[moved to another topic](/help/move-content-to-another-topic)
or [stream](/help/move-content-to-another-stream) or
if its [topic is resolved](/help/resolve-a-topic).

OneHash Connect uses the same permanent link syntax when [quoting a
message](/help/quote-and-reply).
