# Share and upload files

OneHash Connect supports attaching multiple files to messages, including images,
documents, sound, and video. You can edit the names of the files others see
after you upload them.

OneHash Connect will automatically generate a **thumbnail** for each file when you send
the message, if it can. Image thumbnails will be shown directly in the message,
and you can click on a thumbnail to [view the full image](/help/view-and-browse-images).

This limit can be changed by the server administrator.
