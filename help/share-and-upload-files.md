# Share and upload files

OneHash Connect supports attaching multiple files to messages, including images,
documents, sound, and video. You can edit the names of the files others see
after you upload them.

For images and videos, a small preview will be shown directly in the message.
People reading the message can click on the preview to
[view the full-size image or video](/help/view-images-and-videos).
