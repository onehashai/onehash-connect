# Message retention policy

{!owner-only.md!}

By default, OneHash Connect stores messages indefinitely, allowing full-text
search of your complete history.

OneHash Connect supports configuring both a global organization-level message
retention policy, as well as retention policies for individual
streams.  These policies control how many days a message is stored
before being automatically deleted (the default being forever).
OneHash Connect's system supports:

* Setting an organization-level retention policy, which applies to
  all direct messages and all streams without a specific policy.
* Setting a retention policy for individual streams, which overrides
  the organization-level policy for that stream.  This can be used to
  just delete messages on specific streams, to only retain messages
  forever on specific streams, or just to have a different retention
  period.

In OneHash Connect Cloud, message retention policies are available on the OneHash Connect
Cloud Standard and OneHash Connect Cloud Plus [plans](https://zulip.com/plans/),
as well as for the hundreds of communities with sponsored Cloud
Standard hosting.

## Important details

* Retention policies are processed in a daily job; so changes in the
  policy won't have any effect until the next time the daily job runs.

* Deleted messages are preserved temporarily in a special archive.  So
if you discover a misconfiguration accidentally deleted content you
meant to preserve, contact OneHash Connect support promptly for assistance with
restoration.  See the [deletion
documentation](/help/delete-a-message#delete-a-message-completely) for
more details on precisely how message deletion works in OneHash Connect.
