# Restrict account creation

{!owner-only.md!}

Each OneHash Connect account is associated with an email address. If your organization
allows multiple authentication methods, it doesn't matter which one is used to
create an account. All authentication methods will work for all users in your
organization, provided that they are associated with the account email. To log
in with email, users are required to verify their email account by clicking on a
validation link.

OneHash Connect provides a number of configuration options to control who can create a new
account and how users access their accounts:

* You can [require an invitation](#set-whether-invitations-are-required-to-join)
  to sign up (default), or you can [allow anyone to
  join](#set-whether-invitations-are-required-to-join) without an invitation.

* You can [restrict the ability to invite new users](#change-who-can-send-invitations) to
 join your OneHash Connect organzation to specific [roles](/help/roles-and-permissions).

Regardless of whether invitations are required, you can:

* [Configure allowed authentication
  methods](/help/configure-authentication-methods).

* [Restrict sign-ups to a fixed list of allowed
  domains](#restrict-sign-ups-to-a-list-of-domains)
  (including subdomains). For example, you can require users to sign up with
  the email domain for your business or university.

* Disallow signups with known [disposable email
  address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_email_address). This
  is recommended for open organizations to help protect against abuse.
