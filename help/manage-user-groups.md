## Configure who can create and manage user groups

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, [all members](/help/roles-and-permissions) in a Zulip
organization can create user groups and manage user groups that they
are a member of. However, you can restrict that ability to specific
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions).

Note that administrators and moderators can modify any user group,
while other organization members can only modify user groups to which
they belong. Guests cannot modify or create user groups.

{start_tabs}

{tab|desktop-web}

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}

1. Under **Other permissions**, configure **Who can create and manage user groups**.
