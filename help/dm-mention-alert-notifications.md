# DMs, mentions, and alerts

You can configure desktop, mobile, and email notifications for
[direct messages (DMs)](/help/direct-messages),
[mentions](/help/mention-a-user-or-group), and [alert
words](#alert-words).

## Configure notifications

These settings will affect notifications for direct messages, group
direct messages, mentions, and alert words.
