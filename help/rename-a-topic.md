# Rename a topic

OneHash Connect makes it possible to rename topics. This is useful for keeping messages
organized, even if some users are still learning how to use topics effectively.
You can also [move content to another
topic](/help/move-content-to-another-topic).

When a topic is renamed, OneHash Connect's [permanent links to messages in
context](/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation#get-a-link-to-a-specific-message)
will automatically redirect to the new location of the message. [Muted
topics](/help/mute-a-topic) are automatically migrated when a topic is renamed.

Organizations can [configure](/help/restrict-moving-messages) which
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions) have permission to rename topics.
