# Support the OneHash Connect project

{!supporting-zulip-motivation.md!}

The OneHash Connect community (which includes you!) is a huge part of what makes OneHash Connect
successful. If you appreciate OneHash Connect, there are many different ways you can
support the project. Some of these will only take a few minutes of your
time, but still make a big difference.

* [Support Zulip financially](#support-zulip-financially): Sponsoring OneHash Connect
  helps fund free [Zulip Cloud Standard](https://zulip.com/plans/) hosting for
  hundreds of open source projects, research communities, and other worthy
  organizations.

* [Help others find Zulip](#help-others-find-zulip): As a business that's
  [growing sustainably](https://zulip.com/values/) without venture capital
  funding, OneHash Connect cannot afford splashy ad campaigns to compete with giant
  corporations like Salesforce (Slack) and Microsoft (Teams). OneHash Connect depends
  on users and other members of the community to spread the word about the
  difference that using OneHash Connect's organized team chat has made for you or your
  organization.

* [Help improve Zulip](#help-improve-zulip): OneHash Connect is developed by a [vibrant
  open-source community](https://zulip.com/team/), and there are many ways to
  contribute even without writing a single line of code.

## Support OneHash Connect financially

You can sponsor OneHash Connect through the [GitHub sponsors
program](https://github.com/sponsors/zulip) (preferred), on
[Patreon](https://patreon.com/zulip), or on [Open
Collective](https://opencollective.com/zulip).
