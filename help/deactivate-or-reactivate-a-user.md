# Deactivate or reactivate a user

## Deactivating a user

{!admin-only.md!}

When you deactivate a user:

* The user will be immediately logged out of all OneHash Connect sessions, including
  desktop, web and mobile apps.

* The user's credentials for logging in will no longer work, including password
  login and [any other login options](/help/configure-authentication-methods)
  enabled in your organization.

* The user's [bots](/help/bots-and-integrations) will be deactivated.

* [Email invitations and invite links](/help/invite-new-users) created by the
  user will be disabled.

* Even if your organization [allows users to join without an
  invitation](/help/restrict-account-creation#set-whether-invitations-are-required-to-join),
  this user will not be able to rejoin with the same email account.

!!! warn ""

    You must go through the deactivation process below to fully remove a user's
    access to your OneHash Connect organization. Changing a user's password or removing
    their single sign-on account will not log them out of their open OneHash Connect
    sessions, or disable their API keys.

bots will be deactivated until the user manually
