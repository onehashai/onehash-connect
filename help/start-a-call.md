## Change your call provider

By default, OneHash Connect integrates with
[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/), a fully-encrypted, 100% open
source video conferencing solution. Organization administrators can also
change the organization's call provider. The call providers
supported by Connect are:

* [Jitsi Meet](/integrations/doc/jitsi)
* [Zoom integration](/integrations/doc/zoom)
* [BigBlueButton integration](/integrations/doc/big-blue-button)

If you choose BigBlueButton as the call provider, there will be a single button
(<i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i>) for starting a call. The call is initiated
with cameras turned off.

!!! tip ""

    It is also possible to disable the video and voice call buttons for your organization
    by setting the provider to "None".

### Change your organization's call provider

as its default call provider. You can also use a self-hosted
instance of Jitsi Meet.

1. Under **Other settings**, select **Custom URL** from the
