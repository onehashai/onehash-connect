## Change your video call provider

By default, OneHash Connect integrates with
[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/), a fully-encrypted, 100% open
source video conferencing solution. Organization administrators can also
change the organization's video call provider. The video call providers
supported by OneHash Connect are:

* [Jitsi Meet](/integrations/doc/jitsi)
* [Zoom integration](/integrations/doc/zoom)
* [BigBlueButton integration](/integrations/doc/big-blue-button)

!!! tip ""

    It is also possible to disable the video call button for your organization by
    setting the provider to "None".
