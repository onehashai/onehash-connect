# Invite new users

You can invite users to join your organization by sending out email invitations,
or creating reusable invitation links to share.

Prior to inviting users to your organization, it is recommended that administrators:

* Configure [default settings](/help/configure-default-new-user-settings) for
  new users.

* Configure the [organization language for automated messages and invitation
  emails][org-lang] for your organization.

When you invite users, you can:

* Set the [role](/help/roles-and-permissions) that they will have when
  they join.

* Configure which streams they will be added to. The organization's
  [default streams](/help/set-default-streams-for-new-users) will be preselected.

Organization administrators can
[configure](/help/restrict-account-creation#change-who-can-send-invitations)
which [roles](/help/roles-and-permissions) have permission to invite users to
the organization. You will only see an **Invite users** menu option if you have
permission to invite users.
