# Restrict permissions of new members

{!owner-only.md!}

In large OneHash Connect organizations where
[anyone can join](/help/restrict-account-creation#set-whether-invitations-are-required-to-join), it can
be useful to restrict what new members can do, to make it easier to cope
with spammers and confused users.

Members are **new members** from when they join till when their account ages
past a certain **waiting period** threshold. After that they are **full members**.
You can configure how long the waiting period is, as well as which actions require
being a full member.

For some features, OneHash Connect supports restricting access to only full members. These
features include [creating streams](/help/configure-who-can-create-streams),
[inviting users to the organization](/help/invite-new-users),
[adding custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji#change-who-can-add-custom-emoji),
and many more.
