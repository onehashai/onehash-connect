# Restrict moving messages

{!admin-only.md!}

OneHash Connect lets you configure which [roles](/help/roles-and-permissions) can edit
message topics and move topics between streams. In general, allowing all
organization members to edit message topics is highly recommended because:

- It allows the community to keep conversations organized, even if some members
  are still learning how to use topics effectively.
- It lets users [resolve topics](/help/resolve-a-topic).
- It makes it possible to fix a typo in the topic of a message you just sent.

You can let users edit topics without a time limit, or prohibit topic editing on
older messages to avoid potential abuse. The time limit will never apply to
administrators and moderators.

Permissions for moving messages between streams can be configured separately.
