# Read receipts

Read receipts let you check who has read a message. You can see read receipts
for any message, including both [stream messages](/help/streams-and-topics) and
[direct messages](/help/direct-messages).

With privacy in mind, OneHash Connect lets you [control][configure-personal-read-recipts]
whether your read receipts are shared, and administrators can
[choose][configure-organization-read-recipts] whether to enable read receipts in
their organization.

!!! tip ""
    Read receipts reflect whether or not someone has marked a message as read,
    whether by viewing it, or [by marking messages as read in
    bulk](/help/marking-messages-as-read).

## View who has read a message

{tab|desktop-web}

{!message-actions-menu.md!}

3. Click **View read receipts**.

{tab|mobile}

{!message-long-press-menu.md!}

{end_tabs}

!!! tip ""
    In addition to a list of names, you will see how many people have read
    the message.

## Configure whether OneHash Connect lets others see when you've read messages

OneHash Connect supports the privacy option of never sharing whether or not you have read
a message. If this setting is turned off, your name will never appear in the
list of read receipts.
