# Import your settings

When you create a OneHash Connect account using an email address already associated with
an account in another OneHash Connect organization, on OneHash Connect Cloud or the same self-hosted
OneHash Connect installation, you can import your user settings from an existing account.
It's a convenient way to preserve the user settings that you've already customized.

!!! tip ""

    Settings that may not apply to all organizations, such as custom profile
    fields, will not be imported.

The import will include your:

- [Name and avatar](/#settings/profile)
- [Privacy settings](/#settings/account-and-privacy)
- [Preferences](/#settings/preferences)
- [Notification settings](/#settings/notifications)
- Tutorial completion status.
