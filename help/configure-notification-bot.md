# Notification bot

The OneHash Connect notification bot automatically generates messages for
various organization level events, including:

* Stream settings changes such as [name](/help/rename-a-stream),
  [description](/help/change-the-stream-description),
  [permission](/help/stream-permissions) and
  [policy](/help/stream-sending-policy) updates (sent to the
  "stream events" topic)
* A topic being [resolved/unresolved](/help/resolve-a-topic)
* New public stream announcements (private streams are not announced)
* New user announcements

The notification bot also generates automated direct messages to
individual users for some user specific events, such as [being
subscribed to a stream][add-users-to-stream] by another user.

Additionally, when [moving messages to another stream][move-messages],
users can have the notification bot send automated notices to help
others find the moved content.

Organization administrators can configure where (and whether)
[new stream](#new-stream-announcements) and
[new user](#new-user-announcements) announcement messages are sent.

Stream messages sent by the notification bot (including the topic)
are translated into the language that the organization has configured
as the [organization language for automated messages and invitation
emails][org-lang]. Direct messages sent by the notification bot to
a user will use [their preferred language](/help/change-your-language).
