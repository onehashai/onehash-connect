# Using OneHash Connect via email

With OneHash Connect, it is possible for some members of you organization to participate
from their email client, without opening the OneHash Connect app after the initial
setup is complete.

## Subscribe a OneHash Connect stream to a mailing list

{start_tabs}

1. Create a mailing list to use with OneHash Connect, or use an existing one.

2. Create a OneHash Connect stream that will receive mailing list traffic, or
   use an existing one.

3. [Find the email address](/help/message-a-stream-by-email#message-a-stream-by-email_1)
   for the stream you created. You can customize the details of how emails
   are formatted in OneHash Connect using the
   [Configuration options][configuration-options].

[configuration-options]: /help/message-a-stream-by-email#configuration-options

4. Add the email address for the stream to the mailing list.
{end_tabs}

New emails sent to the email list will now be mirrored to the stream.

## Setup instructions for email users

If you want to interact with OneHash Connect primarily (or entirely) via your email client:

{start_tabs}

1. [Subscribe](/help/browse-and-subscribe-to-streams) to any streams you are
interested in.

{settings_tab|notifications}

1.  In the **Notification triggers** table, make sure both of the checkboxes
    under **Email** are checked.

1. Close the OneHash Connect window. OneHash Connect does not send email notifications
   while you are actively engaging with the web application.

{end_tabs}

New OneHash Connect messages will now be delivered to your email account. You
can reply directly to the emails coming from OneHash Connect, and your replies
will be posted in the appropriate topic or direct message
conversation on OneHash Connect.
