# Custom profile fields

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, user profiles show their name, email, date they joined, and when
they were last active. You can also add custom profile fields like country
of residence, birthday, manager, Twitter handle, and more.

Custom profile fields are always optional, and do not appear in users'
profiles until they fill them out.

OneHash Connect supports synchronizing custom profile fields from an external
user database such as LDAP or SAML. See the [authentication
methods][authentication-production] documentation for details.

* **Date picker**: For dates, like "Birthday".
* **Link**: For links to websites.
* **External account**: For linking to GitHub, Twitter, etc.
* **Pronouns**: What pronouns should people use to refer to the user? Pronouns
  are displayed in [user mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) autocomplete
  suggestions.

## Display custom fields on user card

Organizations may find it useful to display additional fields on the
user card, such as pronouns, GitHub username, job title, team, etc.

All field types other than "Long text" or "Person" have a checkbox option
that controls whether to display a custom field on the user card.
There's a limit to the number of custom profile fields that can be displayed
at a time. If the maximum number of fields is already selected, all unselected
checkboxes will be disabled.
