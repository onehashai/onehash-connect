# Configure unread message counters

To provide information about unread messages, OneHash Connect can show unread message
counters next to stream names in the left sidebar. This is likely to be helpful
if you generally read (or otherwise [mark as read](/help/marking-messages-as-read))
all the messages in a stream, but may otherwise feel unnecessary.

OneHash Connect offers an option to display a dot instead of an unread counter for streams
in the left sidebar. You can use a dot for all streams, or just for streams you
have [muted](/help/mute-a-stream). You will still be able to see the number of
unread messages in a stream by moving your mouse over it in the left sidebar.

   **Show unread counts for** dropdown.
