# Change your time zone

OneHash Connect always uses your computer's time zone for displaying dates and
timestamps (note that you need to reload OneHash Connect after changing your
computer's time zone for changes to take effect).

By default, OneHash Connect also indirectly displays your time zone to others, via the
**Local time** field of your [user profile](/help/view-someones-profile).
You can change the time zone OneHash Connect displays to others.

### Change your time zone
