# Organization language for automated messages and invitation emails

{!admin-only.md!}

{!translation-project-info.md!}

Each user can use OneHash Connect with [their preferred language][user-lang].
Additionally, if your organization has a primary language other than
American English, you can set the language used for the organization's
automated messages and invitation emails. This setting:

* Determines the language used for automated messages sent to streams
  by the [Zulip notification bot](/help/configure-notification-bot).
  (Automated messages sent to a single user will use that user's
  preferred language).

* Determines the language used for outgoing
  [invitation emails](/help/invite-new-users).

* Is used as the default language for new user accounts when OneHash Connect
  cannot detect their language preferences from their browser,
  including all users [created via the Zulip API][api-create-user].
