# Typing notifications

The Connect web app displays typing notifications in [conversation
views](/help/reading-conversations) and [**All direct
messages**](/help/direct-messages#access-all-dms). Typing
notifications are not shown in streams with more than 100
subscribers. The mobile app displays typing notifications in direct
message conversations.

Typing notifications are only sent while one is actively editing text in
the compose box. They disappear if typing is paused for several seconds,
if all the content of the message is erased, or if the message is
[saved as a draft](/help/view-and-edit-your-message-drafts#save-a-draft).
Just having the compose box open will not send a typing notification.

### Disable typing notifications

If you'd prefer that others not know whether you're typing, you can
configure OneHash Connect to not send typing notifications.

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|account-and-privacy}

1. Under **Privacy**, toggle **Let recipients see when I'm typing direct
   messages** and **Let recipients see when I'm typing messages in streams**.

{end_tabs}
