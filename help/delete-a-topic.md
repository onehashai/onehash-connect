# Delete a topic

{!admin-only.md!}

We generally recommend against deleting topics, but there are a few
situations in which it can be useful:

* Clearing out test messages after setting up an organization.

* Clearing out messages from an overly enthusiastic bot.

* Managing abuse.

In most other cases, [renaming a topic](/help/rename-a-topic) is often a
better idea, or just leaving the topic as is. Deleting a topic can confuse
users who come to the topic later via an email notification.

Note that deleting a topic also deletes every message with that topic,
whereas [archiving a stream](/help/archive-a-stream) does not.

Note that deleting all of the individual messages within a particular
topic also deletes that topic. Structurally, topics are simply an
attribute of messages in OneHash Connect.
