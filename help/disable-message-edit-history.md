# Disable message edit history

{!admin-only.md!}

In OneHash Connect, users can [view the edit history of a message](/help/view-a-messages-edit-history).

To remove the edit history of a single message, it is usually best to
[delete the message](/help/delete-a-message#delete-a-message-completely)
entirely. However, you can also disable viewing of message edit history more
generally.
