# Restrict message editing and deletion

{!admin-only.md!}

OneHash Connect lets you separately configure permissions for editing and deleting
messages, and you can set time limits for both actions. Regardless of the
configuration you select:

* Message content can only ever be modified by the original author.
* Any message can be deleted at any time by an organization administrator.

Note that if a user can edit a message, they can also "delete" it by removing
all the message content. This is different from proper message deletion in two
ways: the original content will still show up in [message edit
history](/help/view-a-messages-edit-history), and will be included in
[data exports](/help/export-your-organization). Deletion permanently (and
irretrievably) removes the message from OneHash Connect.
