# Do Not Disturb

The OneHash Connect desktop app offers a **Do Not Disturb (DND)** mode. Turning on **Do Not
Disturb** mode disables [desktop notifications](/help/desktop-notifications)
across all the organizations you have
[added](/help/logging-in#log-in-for-the-first-time) to the OneHash Connect desktop app.
This can be convenient for avoiding interruptions during a meeting, or when you need
time to focus on your work.
