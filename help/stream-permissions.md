# Stream privacy settings

Streams are similar to chat rooms, IRC channels, or email lists in that they
determine who receives a message. OneHash Connect supports a few types of streams:

* **Public** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-hashtag"></i>):
  Members can join and view the complete message history.
  Public streams are visible to guest users only if they are
  subscribed (exactly like private streams with shared history).

* **Private** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-lock"></i>):
  New subscribers must be added by an existing subscriber. Only subscribers
  and organization administrators can see the stream's name and description,
  and only subscribers can view topics and messages with the stream:
    * In **private streams with shared history**, new subscribers can
    access the stream's full message history.
    * In **private streams with protected history**, new subscribers
    can only see messages sent after they join.

* [**Web-public**](/help/public-access-option) (<i class="zulip-icon
  zulip-icon-globe"></i>): Members can join (guests must be invited by a
  subscriber). Anyone on the Internet can view complete message history without
  creating an account.

## Privacy model for private streams

At a high level:

* Organization owners and administrators can see and modify most
  aspects of a private stream, including the membership and estimated
  traffic. Owners and administrators generally cannot see private
  stream messages or do things that would give them access to private
  stream messages, like adding new subscribers or changing the stream
  privacy settings.

* [Organization members and moderators](/help/roles-and-permissions)
  cannot easily see which private streams exist, or interact with them
  in any way until they are added.  Given a stream name, they can
  figure out whether a stream with that name exists, but cannot see
  any other details about the stream.

* From the perspective of a guest, all streams are private streams,
  and they additionally can't add other members to the streams they
  are subscribed to.

There are two situations in which an organization owner or
administrator can access private stream messages:

* Via some types of [data export](/help/export-your-organization).

* Owners and administrators can change the ownership of a bot. If a
  bot is subscribed to a private stream, then an administrator can get
  access to that stream by taking control of the bot, though the
  access will be limited to what the bot can do. (E.g. incoming
  webhook bots cannot read messages.)
