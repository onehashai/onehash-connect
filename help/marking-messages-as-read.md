# Marking messages as read

OneHash Connect automatically keeps track of which messages you have and haven't read.
Unread messages have a line along the left side, which fades when the message
gets marked as read.

OneHash Connect offers tools to manually mark one or more messages as read, and you can
configure whether messages are marked as read automatically when you scroll.

## Configure whether messages are automatically marked as read

You may want to configure whether or not the OneHash Connect app will automatically
mark messages as read. For example, it can be useful to set the mobile app to
never mark messages as read if you often want to follow up on messages when you
are at your computer. You will still be able to
[manually](#mark-all-messages-as-read) mark messages as read.
