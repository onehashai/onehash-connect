In OneHash Connect, streams determine who gets a message. They are similar to
channels in IRC/Slack/Discord, chat rooms, and email lists.

We recommend setting up some streams before inviting other users to
join OneHash Connect, so that you can [automatically subscribe
everyone](/help/set-default-streams-for-new-users) to the right set of
streams.

If you later create additional streams, no worries! You can always add
a group of users or all the members of another stream to a new stream.

!!! tip ""
    Add clear descriptions to your streams, especially public streams.
