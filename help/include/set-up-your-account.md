    If this is your first time using OneHash Connect, we recommend starting with the web
    or desktop experience to set up your account and get oriented.

- Get the [mobile and desktop apps](/apps/). OneHash Connect also works great in a
  [browser](/help/supported-browsers).

- [Add a profile picture](/help/change-your-profile-picture) and
  [edit your profile information](/help/edit-your-profile) to tell others
  about yourself.

- [Review your Preferences](/help/review-your-settings#review-your-preferences).
  You can [switch between light and dark theme](/help/dark-theme),
  [pick your favorite emoji theme](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#change-your-emoji-set),
  [change your language](/help/change-your-language), and make other tweaks to your OneHash Connect experience.

- [Browse and subscribe to streams](/help/browse-and-subscribe-to-streams).

- Decide whether you want <kbd>Enter</kbd> [to send your message
  or add a new line](/help/mastering-the-compose-box#toggle-between-ctrl-enter-and-enter-to-send-a-message).

- [Configure your notifications](/#settings/notifications) to work the way
  you do. If you're joining a low traffic organization and aren't using the
  desktop app, consider sending all messages to email.
