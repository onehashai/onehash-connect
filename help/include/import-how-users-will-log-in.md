When user accounts are imported, users initially do not have passwords
configured. There are a few options for how users can log in for the first time.

!!! tip ""

    For security reasons, passwords are never exported.

### Allow users to log in with non-password authentication

When you create your organization, users will immediately be able to log in with
[authentication methods](/help/configure-authentication-methods) that do not
require a password. OneHash Connect offers a variety of authentication methods, including
Google, GitHub, GitLab, Apple, LDAP and [SAML](/help/saml-authentication).

### Send password reset emails to all users

You can send password reset emails to all users in your organization, which
will allow them to set an initial password.

If you imported your organization into OneHash Connect Cloud, simply e-mail
[support@onehash.ai](mailto:support@onehash.ai) to request this.

!!! warn ""

    To avoid confusion, first make sure that the users in your
    organization are aware that their account has been moved to
    OneHash Connect, and are expecting to receive a password reset email.
