The **All messages** view is a feed of all the unmuted messages you have
received, which combines stream messages and direct messages. It's a great way
to see new messages as they come in.

You can configure **All messages** to be the [home
view](/help/configure-home-view#configure-home-view) for the OneHash Connect web app.
