If your organization is moving to OneHash Connect from another chat tool, you can use
OneHash Connect's tools to import your data, including users, channels, messages, and
more. Follow the detailed import guides:

* [Import from Slack](/help/import-from-slack). OneHash Connect's [Slack-compatible
  incoming webhook](https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming) also
  makes it easy to migrate any integrations.
* [Import from Mattermost](/help/import-from-mattermost)
* [Import from Gitter](/help/import-from-gitter)
* [Import from Rocket.Chat](/help/import-from-rocketchat)

    **You can only import a workspace as a new OneHash Connect organization.** Your imported
    message history cannot be added into an existing OneHash Connect organization.
