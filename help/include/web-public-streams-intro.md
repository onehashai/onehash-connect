The public access option lets administrators configure selected streams to be
**web-public**. Web-public streams can be viewed by anyone on the Internet
without creating an account in your organization.

For example, you can [link to a Zulip
topic](/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation) in a web-public stream
from a GitHub issue, a social media post, or a forum thread, and
anyone will be able to click the link and view the discussion in the
OneHash Connect web application without needing to create an account.

To see this feature in action, you can [view web-public streams in the Zulip
development community](https://chat.zulip.org/) without logging in.

Users who wish to post content will need to create an account in order
to do so.
