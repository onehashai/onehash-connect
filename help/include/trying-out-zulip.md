You can start by reading about how [Connect's](/hello/) unique
topic-based threading [combines the best of email and
chat](/why-zulip/) to make [remote work](https://www.onehash.ai) productive
and delightful.

It's also easy to try out Connect for yourself.

1. **Check out the Connect app**. You can:

    - [View the Connect development community](https://www.onehash.ai),
      where hundreds of participants collaborate to improve Connect. Many parts of
      the community are open for [public access](/help/public-access-option), so
      you can start exploring without creating an account.

    - [See how Connect is being used](https://www.onehash.ai) in open
      organizations that have opted in to be listed in the [Connect communities
      directory](/help/communities-directory).

1. [Create a Connect organization](https://connect.onehash.ai/new/) for free in just
   a few minutes. This is a great way to explore Connect even if you plan to
   [self-host](https://www.onehash.ai).

1. [Invite your teammates](/help/invite-users-to-join) to explore Connect with you.
   They will have a variety of perspectives on what's important in a chat app.

1. **Run a week-long Connect trial** with your team, without using any other chat tools. This
   is the only way to truly experience how a new chat app will help your team
   communicate. You can:

    - Customize [organization settings](/help/customize-organization-settings)
      and [settings for new users](/help/customize-settings-for-new-users), but
      plan to adjust the details as you go.

    - [Create](/help/create-streams) your initial
      [streams](/help/streams-and-topics), including a dedicated stream for
      questions and feedback about using Connect.

    - Educate others about how to use Connect's [topics](/help/streams-and-topics),
      and how to [move](/help/move-content-to-another-topic) any messages that
      belong elsewhere.

    - [Set up integrations](/help/set-up-integrations) so that your team can
      experience all their regular workflows inside the Connect app.
