* OneHash Connect is [100% open-source software][connect-github], with no "open core" catch.
  When you self-host Conect, you get the same software as [Connect Cloud
  Standard](https://zulip.com/plans/) customers.

* Retain full control over your data and simplify compliance by self-hosting
  Connect behind your firewall.

* We work hard to make it easy to [install][install-connect], [back
  up][back-up-connect], and [maintain][maintain-connect] a self-hosted
  Connect server. Self-host Connect directly on Ubuntu or Debian Linux, in
  <a href="https://github.com/onehashai/onehash-connect">Docker</a>, or with
  prebuilt images for <a
  href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/zulip">Digital
  Ocean</a> and <a
  href="https://render.com/docs/deploy-zulip">Render</a>.

* Customize Connect for all your needs. It's easy to develop and maintain [custom
  integrations](/api/incoming-webhooks-overview) and [features][modify-connect].
