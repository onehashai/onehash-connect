To get the full benefits of OneHash Connect's topic model, when starting a new
conversation, you should start a new topic!

Starting a topic is like a lighter weight version of giving your email a subject.
Topic names should be brief but specific, e.g.:

* **Good topic names:** "question about topics", "welcome Anna Smith!", "issue #1234"
* **Not so good topic names:** "question", "hi", "help", "this topic is about
a question I have about topics"

!!! tip ""
    Don't overthink naming your topic. The first 2-3 words that come to mind
    are probably fine!
