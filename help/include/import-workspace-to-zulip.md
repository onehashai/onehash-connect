You can import your current workspace into a OneHash Connect organization. It's a great way
to preserve your workspace history when you migrate to OneHash Connect, and to
make the transition easy for the members of your organization.

The import will include your organization's:

* **Name** and **Logo**
* **Message history**, including attachments and emoji reactions
* **Users**, including names, emails, roles, avatars, time zones, and custom profile fields
* **Channels**, including all user subscriptions
* **Custom emoji**
