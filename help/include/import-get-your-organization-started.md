Once the import process is completed, you will need to:

{start_tabs}

1. [Configure the settings for your organization](/help/customize-organization-settings),
    which are not exported. This includes settings like [email
    visibility](/help/configure-email-visibility), [message editing
    permissions](/help/restrict-message-editing-and-deletion),
    and [how users can join your organization](/help/restrict-account-creation).

2. All users from your previous workspace will have accounts in your new OneHash Connect
   organization. However, you will need to let users know about their new
   accounts, and [decide how they will log
   in](/help/import-from-slack#decide-how-users-will-log-in) for the first time.

3. Share the URL for your new OneHash Connect organization, and (recommended) the [Getting
   started with Zulip guide](/help/getting-started-with-connect).

4. Migrate any [integrations](/integrations/).
