# Restrict name and email changes

## Restrict name changes

By default, any user can [change their name](/help/change-your-name).
You can instead prevent users from changing their name. This setting is
especially useful if user names are managed via an external source, and
synced into OneHash Connect via the [Zulip API](/api), [LDAP][ldap-sync-data] or
another method.

!!! tip ""

    Organization administrators can always [change anyone's
    name](/help/change-a-users-name).

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}

1. Under **User identity**, select **Prevent users from changing their
   name**.

{!save-changes.md!}

{end_tabs}

## Restrict email changes

By default, any user can [change their email address][change-email].
However, you can instead prevent users from changing their email
address. This setting is especially useful for organizations that
are using [LDAP][ldap-sync-data] or another single sign-on solution
to manage user emails.

!!! tip ""

    Organization administrators can always change their own email
    address.

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}

1. Under **User identity**, select **Prevent users from changing their
   email address**.
