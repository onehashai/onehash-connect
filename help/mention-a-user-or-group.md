## Mention all topic participants

Using the `@**topic**` mention, you can mention everyone who has previously
participated in the topic by sending a message or
[reacting](/help/emoji-reactions) with an emoji. This lets you notify just those
who have already engaged in the conversation.

Users can disable notifications for `@**topic**` mentions by:

- Disabling notifications for wildcard mentions
[globally](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) or for [individual
streams](/help/stream-notifications).

- Muting the [topic](/help/mute-a-topic) or [stream](/help/mute-a-stream).

## Mention everyone on a stream

You can mention everyone on a stream with the `@**all**` mention (or,
equivalently, `@**everyone**` or `@**stream**`). It's best to use these mentions
only when your message requires timely attention from many stream subscribers.
An organization can be configured to
[restrict](/help/restrict-wildcard-mentions) wildcard mentions in large streams.

Users can disable notifications for `@**all**`, `@**everyone**`, and
`@**stream**` mentions by:

- Disabling notifications for wildcard mentions
[globally](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) or for [individual
streams](/help/stream-notifications).

- Muting the [topic](/help/mute-a-topic) or [stream](/help/mute-a-stream).
