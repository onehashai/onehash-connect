# User groups

User groups allow you to [mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) multiple
users at once. When you mention a user group, everyone in the group is
[notified](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) as if they were
individually mentioned.

Note that user groups are not the same as group direct messages. If you're
trying to send a message to a group of people, you'll want to either
[create a stream](/help/create-a-stream), or send a
[group direct message](/help/direct-messages).

{end_tabs}

### Configure who can create and manage user groups

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, [all members](/help/roles-and-permissions) in a OneHash Connect
organization can create user groups and manage user groups that they
are a member of. However, you can restrict that ability to specific
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions).

Note that administrators and moderators can modify any user group,
while other organization members can only modify user groups to which
they belong. Guests cannot modify or create user groups.

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}

1. Under **Other permissions**, configure **Who can create and manage user groups**.
