# Contact support

We're here to help! This page will guide you to the best way to reach us.

## Connect community

The primary communication forum for the Connect community is the Connect server
hosted at www.onehash.ai. Users and administrators of Connect organizations stop
by to ask questions, offer feedback, and participate in product design
discussions.

Everyone is welcome to sign up and participate â€” we love hearing from our users!
Please see the [Connect development community][development-community] guide for
detailed instructions on how to join the community, [community norms][community-norms]
and [where][development-community-streams] to ask your questions or give
feedback.

server, you can request interactive chat support in the [Connect development
