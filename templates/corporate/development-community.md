The primary communication forum for the Zulip community is the Zulip
server hosted at [chat.zulip.org](https://chat.zulip.org/):

- **Users** and **administrators** of Zulip organizations stop by to
  ask questions, offer feedback, and participate in product design
  discussions.
- **Contributors to the project**, including the **core Zulip
  development team**, discuss ongoing and future projects, brainstorm
  ideas, and generally help each other out.

Everyone is welcome to [sign up](https://chat.zulip.org/) and
participate — we love hearing from our users! Public streams in the
community receive thousands of messages a week. We recommend signing
up using the special invite links for
[users](https://chat.zulip.org/join/t5crtoe62bpcxyisiyglmtvb/),
[self-hosters](https://chat.zulip.org/join/wnhv3jzm6afa4raenedanfno/)
and
[contributors](https://chat.zulip.org/join/npzwak7vpmaknrhxthna3c7p/)
to get a curated list of initial stream subscriptions.

To get help in real time, you will have the best luck finding core
developers during daylight hours in North America (roughly between
15:00 UTC and 1:00 UTC), but the sun never sets on the Zulip
community. Most questions get a reply within minutes to a few hours.

You can also [read conversations](https://chat.zulip.org/) in the community
without creating an account. If you are evaluating using Zulip for your
organization, check out these [tips](/try-zulip/) for exploring the product in
action in the development community.

# Community norms

Zulip is a friendly and welcoming community, and we love meeting new
people, hearing about what brought them to Zulip, and getting their
feedback.

## Getting started

- Send test messages to [#test
  here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/7-test-here) or as a PM
  to yourself to avoid disturbing others.
- [Start a new topic](/help/starting-a-new-topic) unless you’re replying
  to an existing conversation. If you see a new user talking about
  something unrelated on an existing topic, [move the messages to an
  appropriate new topic](/help/move-content-to-another-topic).
- If you’re not sure where to start, introduce yourself and your
  interests in [#new
  members](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/95-new-members),
  using your name as the topic to create a dedicated space.
- Follow the community [code of
  conduct](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct.html).

## Communication style

- Converse informally; there’s no need to use titles like “Sir” or “Madam”.
- Use [gender-neutral
  language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language). For
  example, avoid using a pronoun like “her” or “his” in sentences like
  “Every developer should clean [their] keyboard at least once a
  week.”

## Getting help
- When asking for help, provide the details needed for others to help
  you. For example, include the **full traceback** in a [code
  block](/help/code-blocks) (not a screenshot), a link to the code or
  a draft PR you’re having trouble debugging, etc.
- Ask questions on streams rather than DMing core contributors. You’ll
  get answers faster since other people can help, and it makes it
  possible for others to benefit from the discussion.
- Don’t ask the same question in multiple places. Moderators read
  every public stream, and make sure every question gets a reply.
- Use @-mentions sparingly. Unlike IRC or Slack, Zulip’s topics make
  it easy to see what you’re replying to, so you don’t need to mention
  your conversation partner to make sure they will see or understand
  your reply. Core contributors will often @-mention someone who asked
  a question hours earlier to make sure they see the reply, but there
  is generally no need to @-mention a core contributor unless you need
  their timely attention.

# Where do I send my message?

This section describes popular public streams on chat.zulip.org. Kick
off the discussion by [starting a new topic](/help/starting-a-new-topic)
in the appropriate stream! Don’t stress too much about picking the
right place if you’re not sure; anyone in the community can edit a
topic name, and [moderators](/help/roles-and-permissions) can [move a
topic to a different stream](/help/move-content-to-another-stream).

## Streams for everyone

- [#feedback](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/137-feedback) is

  improvements to the UI or existing features, or anything else! We also

  are the best places to post bug reports or questions about Zulip's apps. Note
  that [#desktop](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/16-desktop) should only
  be used for issues specific to the desktop app, which shares most of its UI
  and implementation with the web app.
- Everyone is welcome to introduce themselves in [#new
  members](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/95-new-members). Posting
  here with your name as the topic is a great option if you’re
  uncertain where to start a conversation.
- [#test here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/7-test-here) is

  [#frontend](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/6-frontend),

  areas (including design discussions, questions, updates on a
  project, or anything else).
- [#automated
  testing](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/43-automated-testing)
  is primarily used for automated notifications about [CI
  failures](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing/continuous-integration.html),
  but is also a good place to discuss projects to improve Zulip’s
  automated testing infrastructure.
- [#api design](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/378-api-design)
  is a low-traffic stream for discussing and coordinating changes to
  the [Zulip API](https://zulip.com/api/rest), with all stakeholders

  usually the best place for end users to start a topic about a
  proposed design change;
  [#design](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/101-design) is
  primarily intended for discussing changes the community is actively
  working on.
- [#discussions](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/277-discussions)

# Anything else to keep in mind?

## Don’t try to read *everything*

Keeping up with **everything** happening in the Zulip project is both
difficult and rarely a useful goal. To make the best use of your time,
we highly recommend that you unsubscribe from streams that you aren’t
interested in, mute streams that are only of occasional interest, and
make use of [Zulip’s skimming features](/help/reading-strategies),
like Recent conversations, to spend your time on topics that interest
you.

## Searching for past conversations

To look for previous threads about something, we recommend using the
following [search filters](/help/search-for-messages#search-filters):
`streams:public <your keyword(s)>`.

This will search the full history of all public streams for `<your
keyword(s)>`, including messages sent before you joined and messages
on public streams you’re not subscribed to.

## Linking to GitHub issues and pull requests

We've set up [custom linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier)
so that it's easy to link to issues and pull requests in Zulip
project repositories when composing a message or [starting a new
topic](/help/starting-a-new-topic). Here are examples for linking
to issue 1234 in the main Zulip project repositories:

- [Server and web app][server-web-repository]: `#1234`
- [Mobile client][mobile-repository]: `#M1234`
- [Terminal client][terminal-repository]: `#T1234`
- [Desktop client][desktop-repository]: `#D1234`

## New features are tested here

We [continuously test out new features or ideas][release-lifecycle] on
chat.zulip.org before rolling them out to Zulip Cloud or including
them in a Zulip Server release (or deciding not to!). Please report in
[#issues](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/9-issues) anything you
notice that seems broken! It’s likely you’ve found a bug in an upcoming
feature.
