1. Once the plugin is installed, configure it by going to
   **Manage Jenkins > Configure System**. Scroll to the section
   labeled **Connect Notification Settings**, and specify your
   Connect server address, bot's email address and API key.
   Optionally, you may configure a default stream or topic. You can also enable
   smart notifications (i.e. only receive notifications when a build fails or
   recovers from a failed state).

      (If you don't see this option, you may first need to restart
      Jenkins.)

1. Once you've done that, it's time to configure one of your
   freestyle projects to use the Connect notification plugin. On your
   Jenkins project page, click **Configure** on the left sidebar. Scroll to
   the bottom until you find the section labeled **Post-build
   Actions**. Click the dropdown and select **Connect Notification**.
   It should look as shown below. If you'd rather not use the defaults from
   the global configuration, you can set a custom stream and topic.
   If you don't specify a custom topic, the project name will be used as the
   topic instead. Then click **Save**.

    When your builds fail or succeed, you'll see a message as shown below.

### Advanced use cases

Besides the **Connect Notification** post-build action, this plugin
also supports the **Connect Send** action.
To learn more, see the [plugin's README](https://github.com/jenkinsci/zulip-plugin).

### Troubleshooting

1. Did you set up a post-build action for your project?

1. Does the stream you picked (e.g. `jenkins`) already exist?
   If not, create the stream and make sure you're subscribed to it.

1. Are your API key and email address correct? Test them
   using [our curl API](/api).

1. Configure a Jenkins log recorder for **jenkins.plugins.zulip**
   and check why your messages fail to send.
