By default, Connect integrates with [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/),
a fully-encrypted, 100% open source video conferencing solution.

Connect uses the [cloud version of Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/)
as its default video call provider. You can also use a self-hosted
instance of Jitsi Meet.
