[Zulip release lifecycle](../overview/release-lifecycle.md).

## Zulip Server 8.x series

### Zulip Server 8.0-beta2

_Released 2023-12-12_

#### Highlights

- New Inbox view shows all unread messages in a conveniently
  browsable experience, similar to the mobile home screen. It is an
  option for the user's home view.
- Added support for following a topic, with configurable notification
  settings for followed topics and flexible configuration options to
  automatically follow topics when sending a message or otherwise
  interacting with it, or when mentioned. New `Shift + N` keyboard
  shortcut navigates to the next unread followed topic.
- Added support for limiting user list access for guests.
- New @topic mentions support mentioning only users who have
  participated in a topic by sending a message or emoji reaction.
- Typing notifications now support streams with 100 or fewer
  subscribers.
- Clicking on a message in search views now directly takes the user to
  the target message, instead of starting a reply, since it's rare one
  wants to reply without full context.
- The left sidebar now allows collapsing the global views for users
  who want more space for streams and conversations.
- Added new unread count display style setting, controlling in which
  streams to display a numeric unread count or a simple dot unread
  indicator. Defaults to numeric counts in normal streams, but a dot
  indicator in muted streams.
- Added support for creating voice calls.
- Major visual design improvements in the message feed, search
  area/navbar, and left sidebar. The gear menu was replaced with three
  new redesigned menus: A help menu, a personal/avatar menu, and a
  more focused gear menu.
- Added thumbnails and lightbox player support for video links and
  video files uploaded directly in Zulip. Previously, Zulip only
  supported this for videos hosted by third-party platforms that
  provide an embedded player, like YouTube and Vimeo.
- The compose area was redesigned, with new formatting buttons for
  most message formatting features, including polls. Improved pasting
  URLs with text selected. Topic typeahead now indicates whether one
  would be creating a new topic, and user typeahead now shows pronouns
  if a pronoun custom profile field is configured.

#### Full feature changelog

- Redesigned the "invite users" modal to be more user-friendly.
- Redesigned file upload, including a cancel button, better
  drag-and-drop support, better message-edit handling, and many bug
  fixes.

  Sentry. Regenerated integration screenshots to show the current
  visual design.
- Webhook integrations now return a 200 success status code when
  processing requests that match the format for an integration but
  where the specific event type is not implemented.
- New /health health check endpoint designed for reverse proxies in
  front of the Zulip server.

  the web codebase is now TypeScript, most of the legacy Bootstrap
  code has been deleted, and most import cycles have been cut.
- Added new request parsing framework based on Pydantic 2.
- Upgraded many dependencies.

#### Upgrade notes for 8.0

- Installations using the [Mobile Push Notifications
  Service][mobile-push] now regularly upload [basic
  metadata][mobile-push-metadata] about the organizations hosted by
  the installation to the Mobile Push Notifications
  Service. Previously, basic metadata was uploaded only when uploading
  usage statistics was also enabled via the `SUBMIT_USAGE_STATISTICS`
  setting.
- This release contains several expensive migrations, most notably
  `0472_add_message_realm_id_indexes.py`,
  `0485_alter_usermessage_flags_and_add_index.py`, and
  `0486_clear_old_data_for_unused_usermessage_flags.py`. Migration
  `0486`, in particular, cleans up stale that should only be present
  on Zulip servers that were originally installed with Zulip 1.3.x or
  older. If your server has millions of messages, plan for the
  migrations in this release to take 15 minutes or more to complete.
- Minor: User group names starting with `@`, `role:`, `user:`, and
  various certain other special patterns are now forbidden. In the
  unlikely event that existing user groups have names matching these
  patterns, they will be automatically renamed on upgrade.
- The behavior of the `AUTH_LDAP_ADVANCED_REALM_ACCESS_CONTROL` has
  subtly changed. Previously, using this setting at all would block
  LDAP authentication in organizations that are configured to use LDAP
  authentication but not explicitly configured with advanced access
  controls. This behavior was removed to simplify hosting multiple
  organizations with different LDAP configuration preferences.

## Zulip Server 7.x series

### Zulip Server 7.5

_Released 2023-11-16_

- CVE-2023-47642: Invalid metadata access for formerly subscribed streams.
  It was discovered by the Zulip development team that active users who had
  previously been subscribed to a stream incorrectly continued being able to use
  the Zulip API to access metadata for that stream. As a result, users who had
  been removed from a stream, but still had an account in the organization,
  could still view metadata for that stream (including the stream name,
  description, settings, and an email address used to send emails into the
  stream via the incoming email integration). This potentially allowed users to
  see changes to a stream’s metadata after they had lost access to the stream.
  This bug was present in all Zulip releases prior to Zulip Server 7.5.
- Fixed a bug where [backups](../production/export-and-import.md#backups) might
  be written using `postgresql-client-16`, which could not be straightforwardly
  restored into a Zulip instance, as the format is not backwards-compatible, and
  Zulip does not yet support PostgreSQL 16.
- Renamed the `reactivate_stream` management command to `unarchive_stream`, to
  match terminology in the app, and [documented
  it](https://zulip.com/help/archive-a-stream#unarchiving-archived-streams).
- Fixed a regression, introduced in 6.0, where users created via the API or LDAP
  would have English set as their language, ignoring the configured realm
  default.
- Improved [documentation on `AUTH_LDAP_ADVANCED_REALM_ACCESS_CONTROL`](../production/authentication-methods.md#restricting-ldap-user-access-to-specific-organizations).
- Improved error messages for subdomains being reserved versus being in use.
- Upgraded Python dependencies.

### Zulip Server 7.4

_Released 2023-09-15_

- CVE-2023-4863: Upgrade vulnerable `libwebp` dependency.
- Fixed a left sidebar layout bug affecting languages like Russian
  with very long translations of certain menu items.
- Fixed a bug in the reverse proxy misconfiguration warnings
  introduced in 7.2.
- Fixed a bug causing some exception report emails generated by the
  Zulip server to be unpleasantly verbose.
- Fixed the compose area “Enter sends” configuration incorrectly
  advertising “Enter” instead of “Return” on macOS systems.
- Fixed a CSS bug in the password reset form introduced in 7.3.
- Improved troubleshooting guide discussion of restarting services.
- Upgrade dependencies.

### Zulip Server 7.3

_Released 2023-08-25_

- CVE-2023-32678: Users who used to be subscribed to a private stream, and have
  since been removed from it, retained the ability to edit messages/topics and
  delete messages that they used to have access to, if other relevant
  organization permissions allowed these actions. For example, a user may have
  still been able to edit or delete their old messages they had posted in such a
  private stream.
- Fixed a bug, introduced in Zulip Server 7.0, which would cause uploaded files
  attached to some messages to be mistakenly deleted after some, but not all,
  messages linking to the uploaded file were deleted by the user. See our
  [blog post](https://blog.zulip.com/2023/08/25/uploaded-file-data-loss-incident/) for more details.
- Fixed a bug, introduced in Zulip Server 7.2 in the
  [operating system upgrade process](../production/upgrade.md#upgrading-the-operating-system),
  which would cause errors of the form
  `venv was not set up for this Python version`.
- Fixed a bug, introduced in Zulip Server 7.2, when the
  [email gateway](../production/email-gateway.md)
  was used in conjunction with a
  [reverse proxy](../production/deployment.md#putting-the-zulip-application-behind-a-reverse-proxy).
- Improved the performance of
  [resolving](https://zulip.com/help/resolve-a-topic) or
  [moving](https://zulip.com/help/move-content-to-another-topic) long topics.
- Fixed bad rendering of stream links in
  [stream descriptions](https://zulip.com/help/change-the-stream-description).
- Fixed broken and misaligned images in Zulip welcome emails.
- Fixed YouTube video previews to be ordered in the order they are linked, not
  reverse order.
- Upgraded Python requirements.
- Updated puppet dependencies.
- Improved the [Sentry integration](https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/sentry),
  including making the “Test plugin” button in Sentry work properly.
- Reduced memory usage by replacing a custom error reporting handler with the
  default Django implementation. This will result in a slight change in the
  format of server exception emails. Such emails should be rare in most
  self-hosted systems; installations with a large amount of server exception
  volume should be using the
  [Sentry integration](../subsystems/logging.md#sentry-error-logging).
- Updated the
  [data export tool](../production/export-and-import.md#data-export)
  to handle bots created in very early versions of Zulip Server.
- Fixed a bug with the
  [data export tool](../production/export-and-import.md#data-export)
  and deleted users in group DMs.
- Added a `./manage.py reactivate-stream` command to reactivate archived
  streams.
- Fixed links in the documentation to
  [Modify Zulip](../production/modify.md)
  and
  [Upgrade Zulip](../production/upgrade.md)
  pages.
- Linked the documentation on how to
  [host multiple Zulip](../production/multiple-organizations.md)
  organizations on one server.
- Fixed missing images in documentation for the
  [“XKCD” bot](https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/xkcd).
- Fixed “Back to login page” button alignment in the desktop app.
- Added a reference to
  [PostgreSQL upgrades](../production/upgrade.md#upgrading-postgresql)
  in the
  [release upgrade](../production/upgrade.md#upgrading-to-a-release)
  section.
- Clarified that PostgreSQL versions must match in
  "[Restoring backups](../production/export-and-import.md#restoring-backups)"
  section, and explain how to do that.
- Reformatted Changelog.

### Zulip Server 7.2

_Released 2023-07-05_

- Started logging a more accurate, detailed, and actionable error messages when
  [common reverse proxy misconfigurations][proxies] are detected.

- Improved [reverse proxy documentation][proxies] to clarify that trust of
  `X-Forwarded-Proto` is also necessary.

- Removed [reverse proxy][proxies] nginx configuration files when the
  [`loadbalancer.ips`](../production/deployment.md#ips)
  setting has been unset.
- Improved error-handling of scheduled emails, so they cannot attempt infinite
  deliveries of a message with no recipients.
- Fixed a bug with the
  [PGroonga integration](../subsystems/full-text-search.md#multi-language-full-text-search)
  that would cause the PostgreSQL server to crash when a search was run.
- Fixed a bug that would cause some messages not to be marked as read.
- Fixed a bug that still showed file-upload banners after re-opening the compose
  box.
- Fixed a bug that prevented file uploads with very unusual file names.
- Adjusted the bot icon to make it more visible on the light theme.
- Fixed minor rendering issues on the “press enter to send” indicator.
- Fixed the scrollbar behavior on the stream settings page.
- Improved error reporting when a Slack token fails to validate during
  [import](https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack#export-your-slack-data),
  such as a token having too few permissions.
- Added support for IPv6
  [nameservers in the nginx configuration](../production/deployment.md#nameserver).
- Updated translations.

[proxies]: ../production/deployment.md#configuring-zulip-to-trust-proxies

### Zulip Server 7.1

_Released 2023-06-13_

- Added checks to check that Zulip is being installed on a
  [supported CPU and OS architecture](../production/requirements.md).
- Improved error-handling around the
  [`upgrade-postgresql`](../production/upgrade.md#upgrading-postgresql)
  tool.
- Fixed a couple bugs in database migrations as part of the upgrade that could
  cause the upgrade to fail to complete.
- Fixed a bug where
  [scheduled messages](https://zulip.com/help/schedule-a-message) with `@all`
  would fail to send.
- Fixed a bug which would sometimes cause the `j` and `k` keys to not be able to
  be typed in the compose box.
- Fixed anonymous access to the “download” link on images in
  [public-access streams](https://zulip.com/help/public-access-option).
- Changed the default DNS resolver in nginx’s configuration to match the
  system’s; this fixes deployments which use the
  [S3 storage backend](../production/upload-backends.md)
  and did not run `systemd-resolved`, like Docker and some versions of Debian.
- Updated several pieces of documentation.
- Updated translations, including new translations for Luri (Bakhtiari),
  Brazilian Portuguese, and Tagalog.

### Zulip Server 7.0

_Released 2023-05-31_

#### Highlights

- Many significant visual changes as part of Zulip's ongoing redesign
  project, including message feed headers, background color, mention
  colors, dates and times, compose box banners, icons, and
  tooltips. Many further improvements are planned for future releases.
- Added support for unmuting a topic in a muted stream, previously the
  4th most upvoted GitHub issue.
- Redesigned the permissions settings for message editing, topic
  editing, and moving topics to have a cleaner model.
- New compose box features: Scheduling a message to be sent later, a
  nicer stream picker, and the ability to switch between stream and
  private messages.
- Numerous improvements to the Help Center, including documentation
  for how to complete many common tasks in the Zulip mobile apps.
- Redesigned the interface and permissions model for moving topics to
  be independent from message content editing, providing a cleaner
  experience and better configurability.
- Renamed "Private messages" to "Direct messages" across the user
  interface, including search operators. We expect further API changes
  to be integrated gradually over coming releases due to backwards
  compatibility considerations.
- Added a new personal privacy setting for to what extent the user's
  email address should be shared with other users in the organization;
  previously this was solely controlled by organization
  administrators. This is presented to the user during account
  creation, including for users imported from other chat products.
- Added support for the upcoming Debian 12 release.

#### Full feature changelog

- Added full support for using JWT authentication to integrate Zulip
  with another application.

  users and seeing their user cards after a click.
- Improved previously unspecified behavior when multiple overlapping
  linkifiers applied to syntax within a message.
- Improved subject lines for email notifications in topics that have
  been resolved so that email clients will thread them with the

  been deleted. This is an ongoing project.
- Converted many JavaScript modules to TypeScript.
- Reorganized the codebase, with new web/, help/, and api_docs/
  top-level directories.
- Upgraded many third-party dependencies, including to Django 4.2 LTS.

#### Upgrade notes for 7.0

- When the [S3 storage backend](../production/upload-backends.md) is used for
  storing file uploads, those contents are now fetched by nginx, cached locally
  on the server, and served to clients; this lets clients cache the contents,
  and saves them a redirect. However, it may require administrators adjust the
  size of the server's cache if they have a large deploy; see the
  [documentation](../production/upload-backends.md#s3-local-caching).
- Removed the `application_server.no_serve_uploads` setting in
  `/etc/zulip/zulip.conf`, as all uploads requests go through Zulip now.
- Installations using the previously undocumented [JWT authentication
  feature](../production/authentication-methods.md#jwt) will need
  to make minor adjustments in the format of JWT requests; see the
  documentation for details on the new format.
- High volume log files like `server.log` are now by default retained
  for 14 days, configured via the `access_log_retention_days`
  [deployment
  option](../production/deployment.md#system-and-deployment-configuration). This
  replaces a harder to understand size-based algorithm that was not
  easily configurable.
- The URL patterns for
  [linkifiers](https://zulip.com/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) have
  been migrated from a custom format string to RFC 6570 URL
  templates. A database migration will automatically migrate existing
  linkifiers correctly in the vast majority of cases, but some fancier
  linkfiers may require manual adjustment to generate correct URLs
  following this upgrade.
- PostgreSQL 11 is no longer supported; if you are currently using it, you will
  need to [upgrade PostgreSQL](../production/upgrade.md#upgrading-postgresql)
  before upgrading Zulip.
- Installations that deploy Zulip behind a [reverse proxy][reverse-proxy-docs]
  should make sure the proxy is configured to set the `X-Forwarded-Proto` HTTP
  header, and that [`loadbalancer.ips` is accurate][loadbalancer-ips] for the
  reverse proxy's IP; the documentation has updated its example configurations.
- Zulip's Twitter preview integration has been disabled due to Twitter
  desupporting the API that it relied on.

## Zulip Server 6.x series

### Zulip Server 6.2

_Released 2023-05-19_

- CVE-2023-28623: Fixed a vulnerability that would allow users to sign up for a
  Zulip Server account with an unauthorized email address, despite the server
  being configured to require that email addresses be in LDAP. Specifically, if
  the organization permissions don't require invitations to join, and the only
  configured authentication backends were `ZulipLDAPAuthBackend` and some other
  external authentication backend (any aside from `ZulipLDAPAuthBackend` and
  `EmailAuthBackend`), then an unprivileged remote attacker could have created a
  new account in the organization with an arbitrary email address in their
  control that was not in the organization's LDAP directory.
- CVE-2023-32677: Fixed a vulnerability which allowed users to invite new users
  to streams when inviting them to the server, even if they did not have
  [permission to invite existing users to streams](https://zulip.com/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-streams).
  This did not allow users to invite others to streams that they themselves were
  not a member of, and only affected deployments with the rare configuration of
  a permissive
  [realm invitation policy](https://zulip.com/help/restrict-account-creation#change-who-can-send-invitations)
  and a strict
  [stream invitation policy](https://zulip.com/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-streams).
- Fixed a bug that could cause duplicate push notifications when using the
  mobile push notifications service.
- Fixed several bugs in the Zulip server and PostgreSQL version upgrade
  processes.
- Fixed multiple Recent conversations display bugs for private message
  conversations.
- Fixed the left sidebar stream list exiting “more topics” during background
  re-rendering, and a related rendering bug.
- Fixed a bug where uploaded files sent via the email gateway were not correctly
  associated with the message’s sender.
- Improved error handling for certain puppet failures.
- Silenced a distracting `caniuse browserlist` warning in install/upgrade
  output.
- Simplified UI for inviting new users to make it easy to select the default
  streams.
- Fixed GPG check error handling for PGroonga apt repository.
- Documented how to manage email address changes when using the LDAP backend.
- Documented how to use SMTP without authentication.
- Documented that the Zulip mobile/desktop apps now only support Zulip Server
  4.0 and newer (released 22 months ago), following our 18-month support policy.
- Extracted the documentation on modifying Zulip to a dedicated page.
- Added a new `send_welcome_bot_message` management command, to allow the
  sysadmin to send Welcome Bot messages manually after a data import.
- Added new `RABBITMQ_USE_TLS` and `RABBITMQ_PORT` settings for installations
  wanting to configure the RabbitMQ connection with a remote RabbitMQ host.
- Added a new `timesync` deployment option to allow installations to override
  Zulip’s default of `chrony` for time synchronization.
- Upgraded dependencies for security and bug fixes.

- Updated the Intercom integration to return success on `HEAD`
  requests, which it uses to verify its configuration.
- Documented how each
  [rate limit](../production/security-model.md#rate-limiting)
  category is used.
- Documented the `reset_authentication_attempt_count` command for when users
  lock themselves out.
- Documented the
  [full S3 bucket policy](../production/upload-backends.md#s3-bucket-policy)
  for avatar and uploads buckets.
- Clarified what the `--email` value passed to the installer will be used for.
- Hid harmless "non-existent database" warnings during initial installation.
- Forced a known locale when upgrading PostgreSQL, which avoids errors when
  using some terminal applications.
- Verified that PostgreSQL was running after upgrading it, in case a previous
  try at an upgrade left it stopped.
- Updated custom emoji migration 0376 to be a single SQL statement, and no
  longer crash when no active owners were found.
- Replaced `transifex-client` internationalization library with new
  `transifex-cli`.
- Began respecting proxy settings when installing `shellcheck` and `shfmt`
  tools.
- Fixed the invitation code to signal a user data validation error, and not a
  server error, if an invalid “invite as” value was given.
- Renamed internal exceptions to end with `Error`.

### Zulip Server 6.0

_Released 2022-11-17_

#### Highlights

- Users can now mark messages as unread.
- Added support for viewing read receipts, along with settings
  allowing both organizations and individual users to disable them.
- Added new compose box button to navigate to the conversation being
  composed to, when that is different from the current view.
- Added a scroll-to-bottom button, analogous to the `End` shortcut,
  that appears only when scrolling using the mouse.
- Added support for up to 2 custom profile fields being highlighted in
  a user's profile summary popover, and added support for a new
  Pronouns custom field type designed to take advantage of
  it. Redesigned the custom profile fields administrative UI.
- Redesigned the left sidebar to better organize pinned and inactive
  streams, highlight topics where the user was mentioned, and better
  advertise streams that the current user can subscribe to.
- Redesigned the private messages experience in the left sidebar to
  make browsing conversations more ergonomic, with a similar usage
  pattern to browsing the topics within a stream.
- Improved "Recent topics" and renamed it to "Recent conversations"
  with the addition of including private messages in the view. The
  timestamp links now go to the latest message in the topic, arrow key
  navigation was improved, topics containing unread mentions are now
  highlighted, as well as many other bug fixes or subtle improvements.
- Messages containing 3 or fewer emoji reactions now display the names
  of reacting users alongside the emoji. This eliminates the need to
  mouse over emoji reactions to find out who reacted in the vast
  majority of cases.
- Replaced the previous "Unavailable" status with a "Go invisible" feature
  that is more useful and intuitive.
- The right sidebar now displays user status messages by default, with
  an optional compact design available.
- The [public access option][public-access-option] was enhanced to
  skip the login page by default, support switching themes and
  languages, and add many other UI improvements.
- Incoming webhook integrations now support filtering which classes of events
  are sent into Zulip; this can be invaluable when the third-party service
  doesn't support configuring which events to send to Zulip.
- Added support for Ubuntu 22.04.
- Removed support for Debian 10 and PostgreSQL 10 due to their
  approaching end-of-life upstream.
- New integrations: Azure DevOps, RhodeCode, wekan.

[public-access-option]: https://blog.zulip.com/2022/05/05/public-access-option/

#### Full feature changelog

- Redesigned the message actions popover to be better organized.
- Redesigned moving messages to have a cleaner, more consistent UI that is no
  longer combined with the message editing UI. One can now choose to send
  automated notices when moving messages within a stream, not only between
  streams.
- Redesigned full user profiles to have a cleaner look and also
  display user IDs, which can be important when using the API. Users
  can now administer bot stream subscriptions from the bot's full
  profile.
- Redesigned the gear menu to display basic details about the Zulip
  organization, server, and its version.
- Redesigned several organization settings pages to have more
  consistent design.
- Redesigned the footer for self-hosted Zulip servers. The footer now has just a
  few key links, rather than being almost identical to the footer for the
  zulip.com website.
- Redesigned the 500 error pages for self-hosted Zulip servers to be
  clearer and link to the Zulip server troubleshooting guide.
- Redesigned the interface for configuring message editing and
  deletion permissions to be easier to understand.
- Added support for emoji added in unicode versions since 2017, which
  had previously been unavailable in Zulip. Users using the deprecated
  "Google blobs" emoji set are automatically migrated to the modern
  "Google" emoji set. The "Google blobs" emoji set remains available
  for users who prefer it, with any new emoji that were added to the
  Unicode standard since 2017 displayed in the modern "Google" style.
- Added support for changing the role of bots in the UI; previously,
  this was only possible via the API.
- Added confirmation modals for various destructive actions, such as
  deactivating bots.
- Added new summary statistics on the organization analytics
  page. Fixed several bugs with the display of analytics graphs.
- Added support for administrators sending a final email to a user as
  part of deactivating their Zulip account.
- Added API endpoint to get a single stream by ID.
- Added beta support for user groups to have subgroups, and for some
  permissions settings to be managed using user groups. Over the
  coming releases, we plan to migrate all Zulip permissions settings
  to be based on this more flexible groups-based system. We currently
  expect this migration to be fully backwards-compatible.
- Added a new compliance export management command.
- Zulip's automated emails use the `X-Auto-Response-Suppress` header
  to reduce auto-responder replies.
- Changed various icons to be more intuitive. The bell-based icon for
  muted topics has been replaced by a more standard muted speaker icon.
- Reworked how a new user's language is set to prefer their browser's
  configured language over the organization's configured
  language. This organization-level setting has been renamed to
  "Language for automated messages and invitation emails" to reflect
  what it actually does following this change.
- Organized the Drafts panel to prioritize drafts matching the current
  view.
- Added an automated notification to the "stream events" topic when
  changing a stream's privacy settings.
- Added support for conveniently overriding the default rate-limiting rules.
- Improved the search typeahead to show profile pictures for users.
- Improved typeahead matching algorithm for stream/user/emoji names
  containing multiple spaces and other corner cases.
- Improved the help center, including better display of keyboard
  shortcuts, mobile documentation for common workflows and many polish
  improvements.
- Improved API documentation, including a new page on roles and
  permissions, an audit to correct missing **Changes** entries, and
  new documentation for several previously undocumented endpoints.
- Improved Python static type-checking to make use of Django stubs for
  `mypy`, fixing many minor bugs in the process.
- Improved RealmAuditLog to cover several previously unauditable changes.
- Improved the experience for users who have not logged in for a long
  time, and receive an email or push notification about a private
  message or personal mention. These users are now automatically soft
  reactivated at the time of the notification, for a smoother
  experience when they log in.
- Improved the Tornado server-to-client push system's sharding system
  to support realm regular expressions and experimental support for
  splitting a single realm across multiple push server processes.
- Improved user deactivation modal to provide details about bots and
  invitations that will be disabled.
- Improve matching algorithm for left sidebar stream filtering.
- Improved several integrations, including CircleCI, Grafana, Harbor,
  NewRelic, and the Slack compatible incoming webhook. Git webhooks
  now use a consistent algorithm for choosing shortened commit IDs to
  display.
- Improved mention typeahead and rendering for cases where mention
  syntax appears next to symbols.
- Improved browser window titles used by the app to be clearer.
- Improved the language in message notification emails explaining
  why the notification was sent.
- Improved interface for accessing stream email addresses.
- Reordered the organization settings panels to be more intuitive.
- Increased timeout for processing slow requests from 20s to 60s.
- Removed the "user list in left sidebar in narrow windows" setting.
- Removed limits that prevented replying to Zulip email notifications multiple
  times or, several days after receiving them.
- Fixed numerous bugs and performance issues with the Rocket.Chat data
  import tool. Improved importing emoji from Slack.
- Fixed several bugs where drafts could fail to be saved.
- Fixed a bug where copy-paste would incorrectly copy an entire message.
- Fixed the app's main loading page to not suggest reloading until
  several seconds have passed.
- Fixed multiple bugs that could cause the web app to flood the server
  with requests after the computer wakes up from suspend.
- Fixed a bug where public streams imported from other chat systems
  could incorrectly be configured as public streams without shared
  history, a configuration not otherwise possible in Zulip.
- Fixed several subtle bugs involving editing custom profile field
  configuration.
- Fixed several bugs involving compose box keyboard shortcuts.
- Fixed dozens of settings UI interaction design bugs.
- Fixed subtle caching bugs in the URL preview system.
- Fixed several rare race conditions in the server implementation.
- Fixed many CSS corner cases issues involving content overflowing containers.
- Fixed entering an emoji in the mobile web app using an emoji
  keyboard.
- Fixed Enter being processed incorrectly when inputting a character
  into Zulip phonetically via an IME composing session.
- Fixed several subtle bugs with confirmation links.
- Fixed a subtle performance issue for full-text search for uncommon words.
- Fixed the estimator for the size of public data exports.
- Fixed "mark all as read" requiring a browser reload.
- Major improvements to our documentation for setting up the development
  environment and for joining the project as a new contributor.
- Extracted several JavaScript modules to share code with the mobile
  app.
- Replaced several Python linters with Ruff, an incredibly fast
  Python linter written in Rust.
- Upgraded many third-party dependencies including Django 4.1, and
  substantially modernized the Python codebase.

#### Upgrade notes for 6.0

- Installations using [docker-zulip][docker-zulip] will need to [upgrade
  Postgres][docker-zulip-upgrade-database] before upgrading to Zulip
  6.0, because the previous default of Postgres 10 is no longer
  supported by this release.
- Installations using the AzureAD authentication backend will need to
  update `/etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf` after upgrading. The
  `azure_oauth2_secret` secret was renamed to
  `social_auth_azuread_oauth2_secret`, to match our other external
  authentication methods.
- This release contains an expensive migration,
  `0419_backfill_message_realm`, which adds data to a new `realm`
  column in the message table. Expect it to run for 10-15 minutes per
  million messages in the database. The new column is not yet used in
  this release, so this migration can be run in the background for
  installations hoping to avoid extended downtime.
- Custom profile fields with "Pronouns" in their name and the "short
  text" field type were converted to the new "Pronouns" field type.

## Zulip Server 5.x series

### Zulip Server 5.7

_Released 2022-11-16_

- CVE-2022-41914: Fixed the verification of the SCIM account
  management bearer tokens to use a constant-time comparator. Zulip
  Server 5.0 through 5.6 checked SCIM bearer tokens using a comparator
  that did not run in constant time. For organizations with SCIM
  account management enabled, this bug theoretically allowed an
  attacker to steal the SCIM bearer token, and use it to read and
  update the Zulip organization’s user accounts. In practice, this
  vulnerability may not have been practical or exploitable. Zulip
  Server installations which have not explicitly enabled SCIM are not
  affected.
- Fixed an error with deactivating users with `manage.py sync_ldap_user_data`
  when `LDAP_DEACTIVATE_NON_MATCHING_USERS` was enabled.
- Fixed several subtle bugs that could lead to browsers reloading
  repeatedly when the server was updated.
- Fixed a live-update bug when changing certain notifications
  settings.
- Improved error logs when sending push notifications to the push
  notifications service fails.
- Upgraded Python requirements.

### Zulip Server 5.6

_Released 2022-08-24_

- CVE-2022-36048: Change the Markdown renderer to only rewrite known
  local links as relative links, rather than rewriting all local
  links. This fix also protects against a vulnerability in the Zulip
  mobile app (CVE-2022-35962).
- Added hardening against timing attacks to an internal authentication check.
- Improved documentation for hosting multiple organizations on a server.
- Updated dependencies.
- Updated translations.

### Zulip Server 5.5

_Released 2022-07-21_

- CVE-2022-31168: Fix authorization check for changing bot roles. Due
  to an incorrect authorization check in Zulip Server 5.4 and all prior
  releases, a member of an organization could craft an API call that
  would grant organization administrator privileges to one of their bots.
- Added new options to the `restore-backup` tool to simplify restoring
  backups on a system with a different configuration.
- Updated translations, including major updates to the Mongolian and
  Serbian translations.

### Zulip Server 5.4

_Released 2022-07-11_

- CVE-2022-31134: Exclude private file uploads from [exports of public
  data](https://zulip.com/help/export-your-organization#export-of-public-data). We
  would like to thank Antoine Benoist for bringing this issue to our
  attention.
- Upgraded python requirements.
- Improved documentation for load balancers to mention CIDR address
  ranges.
- Documented an explicit list of supported CPU architectures.
- Switched `html2text` to run as a subprocess, rather than a Python
  module, as its GPL license is not compatible with Zulip’s.
- Replaced `markdown-include` python module with a reimplementation,
  as its GPL license is not compatible with Zulip’s.
- Relicensed as GPL the `tools/check-thirdparty` developer tool which
  verifies third-party licenses, due to a GPL dependency by way of
  `python-debian`.
- Closed a potential race condition in the Tornado server, with events
  arriving at exactly the same time as request causing server errors.
- Added a tool to help automate more of the release process.

### Zulip Server 5.3

_Released 2022-06-21_

- CVE-2022-31017: Fixed message edit event exposure in
  protected-history streams.
  Zulip allows a stream to be configured as [private with protected
  history](https://zulip.com/help/stream-permissions#stream-privacy-settings),
  which means that new subscribers should only see messages sent after
  they join. However, due to a logic bug in Zulip Server 2.1.0 through
  5.2, when a message was edited, the server would incorrectly send an
  API event that included both the edited and old content of the
  message to all of the stream’s current subscribers, regardless of
  whether they could see the original message. The impact of this
  issue was reduced by the fact that this API event is ignored by
  official clients, so it could only be observed by a user using a
  modified client or their browser’s developer tools.
- Adjusted upgrade steps to cause servers using PostgreSQL 14 to
  upgrade to PostgreSQL 14.4, which fixes an important potential
  database corruption issue.
- Upgraded the asynchronous request handling to use Tornado 6.
- Fixed a crash when displaying the error message for a failed attempt
  to create a stream.
- Optimized the steps during `upgrade-zulip`, to reduce the amount of
  server downtime.
- Added a `--skip-restart` flag to `upgrade-zulip` which prepares the
  new version, but does not restart the server into it.
- Stopped mirroring the entire remote Git repository directly into
  `/srv/zulip.git`. This mirroring removed local branches and confused
  the state of previous deployments.
- Fixed a bug which could cause the `delete_old_unclaimed_attachments`
  command-line tool to remove attachments that were still referenced
  by deleted (but not yet permanently removed) messages.
- Stopped enabling `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST` by default, which was
  generally unneeded; the proxy documentation now clarifies when it is
  necessary.
- Fixed the nginx configuration to include the default system-level
  nginx modules.
- Only attempt to fix the `certbot` SSL renewal configuration if HTTPS
  is enabled; this addresses a regression in Zulip Server 5.2, where
  the upgrade would fail if an improperly configured certificate
  existed, but was both expired and not in use.
- Improved proxy and database backup documentation.

### Zulip Server 5.2

_Released 2022-05-03_

- Fixed a performance regression in the UI, introduced in 5.0, when
  opening the compose box.
- Fixed a bug which could intermittently cause URL previews to fail,
  if Zulip was being run in Docker or in low-memory environments.
- Fixed an issue which would cause PostgreSQL 10 and PostgreSQL 11 to
  attempt to write each WAL log to S3, even if S3 WAL
  backups/replication were not configured.
- Fixed an issue which prevented the SCIM integration from
  deactivating users.
- Fixed a bug that resulted in an “You unsubscribed” notice
  incorrectly appearing when new messages arrived in a topic being
  viewed via a “near” link.
- Fixed digest emails being incorrectly sent if a user was deactivated
  after the digest was enqueued but before it was processed.
- Fixed warning about `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` being unset when
  explicitly set to empty.
- Fixed incomplete tracebacks when timeouts happen during Markdown
  rendering.
- Fixed some older versions of Zulip Server not being considered when
  comparing for the likely original version of `settings.py`.
- Stopped using the `database_password` if it is set but
  `database_user` is not.
- Stopped trying to fix LetsEncrypt certificate configuration if they
  were not currently in use.
- Sorted and prettified the output of the
  `check-database-compatibility` tool.
- Split the large `zerver/lib/actions.py` file into many files under
  `zerver/actions/`. This non-functional change was backported to
  ensure it remains easy to backport other changes.
- Updated documentation to reflect that current mobile apps are only
  guaranteed to be compatible with Zulip Server 3.0 and later; they
  may also work with earlier versions, with a degraded experience.

### Zulip Server 5.1

_Released 2022-04-01_

- Fixed upgrade bug where preexisting animated emoji would still
  always animate in statuses.
- Improved check that prevents servers from accidentally downgrading,
  to not block upgrading servers that originally installed Zulip
  Server prior to mid-2017.
- Fixed email address de-duplication in Slack imports.
- Prevented an extraneous scrollbar when a notification banner was
  present across the top.
- Fixed installation in LXC containers, which failed due to `chrony`
  not being runnable there.
- Prevented a "push notifications not configured" warning from
  appearing in the new user default settings panel even when push
  notifications were configured.
- Fixed a bug which, in uncommon configurations, would prevent Tornado
  from being restarted during upgrades; users would be able to log in,
  but would immediately be logged out.
- Updated translations.

### Zulip Server 5.0

_Released 2022-03-29_

#### Highlights

- New [resolve topic](https://zulip.com/help/resolve-a-topic) feature
  allows marking topics as ✔ completed. It’s a lightweight way to
  manage a variety of workflows, including support interactions,
  answering questions, and investigating issues.

  images can be previewed in a single message (up from 5), and a new
  grid layout will be used.
- OpenID Connect joins SAML, LDAP, Google, GitHub, Azure Active
  Directory, and more as a supported Single Sign-On provider.
- SAML authentication now supports syncing custom profile
  fields. Additionally, SAML authentication now supports automatic
  account creation and IdP-initiated logout.
- Added SCIM integration for synchronizing accounts with an external
  user database.
- Added support for installation on ARM platforms (including Mac M1).
- Removed support for Ubuntu 18.04, which no longer receives upstream
  security support for key Zulip dependencies.

#### Upgrade notes for 5.0

- This release contains a migration, `0009_confirmation_expiry_date_backfill`,
  that can take several minutes to run on a server with millions of
  messages of history.
- The `TERMS_OF_SERVICE` and `PRIVACY_POLICY` settings have been
  removed in favor of a system that supports additional policy
  documents, such as a code of conduct. See the [updated
  documentation](../production/settings.md) for the new system.

#### Full feature changelog

## Zulip Server 4.x series

### Zulip Server 4.11

_Released 2022-03-15_

- CVE-2022-24751: Zulip Server 4.0 and above were susceptible to a
  race condition during user deactivation, where a simultaneous access
  by the user being deactivated may, in rare cases, allow continued
  access by the deactivated user. This access could theoretically
  continue until one of the following events happens:
  - The session expires from memcached; this defaults to two weeks, and
    is controlled by SESSION_COOKIE_AGE in /etc/zulip/settings.py
  - The session cache is evicted from memcached by other cached data.
  - The server is upgraded, which clears the cache.
- Updated translations.

### Zulip Server 4.10

_Released 2022-02-25_

- CVE-2022-21706: Reusable invitation links could be improperly used
  for other organizations.
- CVE-2021-3967: Enforce that regenerating an API key must be done
  with an API key, not a cookie. Thanks to nhiephon
  (twitter.com/\_nhiephon) for their responsible disclosure of this
  vulnerability.
- Fixed a bug with the `reindex-textual-data` tool, where it would
  sometimes fail to find the libraries it needed.
- Pin PostgreSQL to 10.19, 11.14, 12.9, 13.5 or 14.1 to avoid a
  regression which caused deploys with PGroonga enabled to
  unpredictably fail database queries with the error
  `variable not found in subplan target list`.
- Fix ARM64 support; however, the wal-g binary is not yet supported on
  ARM64 (zulip/zulip#21070).

### Zulip Server 4.9

_Released 2022-01-24_

- CVE-2021-43799: Remote execution of code involving RabbitMQ.
- Closed access to RabbitMQ port 25672; initial installs tried to
  close this port, but failed to restart RabbitMQ for the
  configuration.
- Removed the `rabbitmq.nodename` configuration in `zulip.conf`; all
  RabbitMQ instances will be reconfigured to have a nodename of
  `zulip@localhost`. You can remove this setting from your
  `zulip.conf` configuration file, if it exists.
- Added missing support for the Camo image proxy in the Docker
  image. This resolves a longstanding issue with image previews, if
  enabled, appearing as broken images for Docker-based installs.
- Fixed a bug which allowed a user to edit a message to add a wildcard
  mention when they did not have permissions to send such messages
  originally.
- Fixed a bug in the tool that corrects database corruption caused by
  updating the operating system hosting PostgreSQL, which previously
  omitted some indexes from its verification. If you updated the
  operating system of your Zulip instance from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04,
  or from Debian 9 to 10, you should run the tool,
  even if you did so previously; full details and instructions are
  available in the previous blog post.
- Began routing requests from the Camo image proxy through a
  non-Smokescreen proxy, if one is configured; because Camo includes
  logic to deny access to private subnets, routing its requests
  through Smokescreen is generally not necessary.
- Fixed a bug where changing the Camo secret required running
  `zulip-puppet-apply`.
- Fixed `scripts/setup/compare-settings-to-template` to be able to run
  from any directory.
- Switched Let's Encrypt renewal to use its own timer, rather than our
  custom cron job. This fixes a bug where occasionally `nginx` would
  not reload after getting an updated certificate.
- Updated documentation and tooling to note that installs using
  `upgrade-zulip-from-git` require 3 GB of RAM, or 2 GB and at least 1
  GB of swap.

### Zulip Server 4.8

_Released 2021-12-01_

- CVE-2021-43791: Zulip could fail to enforce expiration dates
  on confirmation keys, allowing users to potentially use expired
  invitations, self-registrations, or realm creation links.
- Began installing Smokescreen to harden Zulip against SSRF attacks by
  default. Zulip has offered Smokescreen as an option since Zulip
  4.0. Existing installs which configured an outgoing proxy which is
  not on `localhost:4750` will continue to use that; all other
  installations will begin having a Smokescreen installation listening
  on 127.0.0.1, which Zulip will proxy traffic through. The version of
  Smokescreen was also upgraded.
- Replaced the camo image proxy with go-camo, a maintained
  reimplementation that also protects against SSRF attacks. This
  server now listens only on 127.0.0.1 when it is deployed as part of
  a standalone deployment.
- Began using camo for images displayed in URL previews. This improves
  privacy and also resolves an issue where an image link to a third
  party server with an expired or otherwise invalid SSL certificate
  would trigger a confusing pop-up window for Zulip Desktop users.
- Fixed a bug which could cause Tornado to shut down improperly
  (causing an immediate full-page reload for their clients) when
  restarting a heavily loaded Zulip server.
- Updated Python dependencies.
- Truncated large “remove” mobile notification events so that marking
  hundreds of private messages or other notifiable messages as read at
  once won’t exceed Apple’s 4 KB notification size limit.
- Slack importer improvements:
  - Ensured that generated fake email addresses for Slack bots are
    unique.
  - Added support for importing Slack exports from a directory, not
    just a .zip file.
  - Provided better error messages with invalid Slack tokens.
  - Added support for non-ASCII Unicode folder names on Windows.
- Add support for V3 Pagerduty webhook.
- Updated documentation for Apache SSO, which now requires additional
  configuration now that Zulip uses a C extension (the `re2` module).
- Fixed a bug where an empty name in a SAML response would raise an
  error.
- Ensured that `deliver_scheduled_emails` and
  `deliver_scheduled_messages` did not double-deliver if run on
  multiple servers at once.
- Extended Certbot troubleshooting documentation.
- Fixed a bug in soft deactivation catch-up code, in cases where a
  race condition had created multiple subscription deactivation
  entries for a single user and single stream in the audit log.
- Updated translations, including adding a Sinhala translation.

### Zulip Server 4.7

_Released 2021-10-04_

- CVE-2021-41115: Prevent organization administrators from affecting
  the server with a regular expression denial-of-service attack
  through linkifier patterns.

### Zulip Server 4.6

_Released 2021-09-23_

- Documented official support for Debian 11 Bullseye, now that it is
  officially released by Debian upstream.
- Fixed installation on Debian 10 Buster. Upstream infrastructure had
  broken the Python `virtualenv` tool on this platform, which we've
  worked around for this release.
- Zulip releases are now distributed from https://download.zulip.com/server/,
  replacing the old `www.zulip.org` server.
- Added support for LDAP synchronization of the `is_realm_owner` and
  `is_moderator` flags.
- `upgrade-zulip-from-git` now uses `git fetch --prune`; this ensures
  `upgrade-zulip-from-git master` with return an error rather than
  using a stale cached version of the `master` branch, which was
  renamed to `main` this month.
- Added a new `reset_authentication_attempt_count` management command
  to allow sysadmins to manually reset authentication rate limits.
- Fixed a bug that caused the `upgrade-postgresql` tool to
  incorrectly remove `supervisord` configuration for `process-fts-updates`.
- Fixed a rare migration bug when upgrading from Zulip versions 2.1 and older.
- Fixed a subtle bug where the left sidebar would show both old and
  new names for some topics that had been renamed.
- Fixed incoming email gateway support for configurations
  with the `http_only` setting enabled.
- Fixed issues where Zulip's outgoing webhook, with the
  Slack-compatible interface, had a different format from Slack's
  documented interface.
- The installation and upgrade documentations now show the latest
  release's version number.
- Backported many improvements to the ReadTheDocs documentation.
- Updated translation data from Transifex.

### Zulip Server 4.5

_Released 2021-07-25_

- Added a tool to fix potential database corruption caused by host OS
  upgrades (was listed in 4.4 release notes, but accidentally omitted).

### Zulip Server 4.4

_Released 2021-07-22_

- Fixed a possible denial-of-service attack in Markdown fenced code
  block parsing.
- Smokescreen, if installed, now defaults to only listening on
  127.0.0.1; this prevents it from being used as an open HTTP proxy if
  it did not have other firewalls protecting incoming port 4750.
- Fixed a performance/scalability issue for installations using the S3
  file uploads backend.
- Fixed a bug where users could turn other users’ messages they could
  read into widgets (e.g. polls).
- Fixed a bug where emoji and avatar image requests were sent through
  Camo; doing so does not add any security benefit, and broke custom
  emoji that had been imported from Slack in Zulip 1.8.1 or earlier.
- Changed to log just a warning, instead of an exception, in the case
  that the `embed_links` worker cannot fetch previews for all links in
  a message within the 30-second timeout. Each preview request within
  a message already has a 15-second timeout.
- Ensured `psycopg2` is installed before starting
  `process_fts_updates`; otherwise, it might fail to start several
  times before the package was installed.
- Worked around a bug in supervisor where, when using SysV init,
  `/etc/init.d/supervisor restart` would only have stopped, not
  restarted, the process.
- Modified upgrade scripts to better handle failure, and suggest next
  steps and point to logs.
- Zulip now hides the “show password” eye icon that IE and Edge
  browsers place in password inputs; this duplicated the
  already-present JavaScript-based functionality.
- Fixed “OR” glitch on login page if SAML authentication is enabled
  but not configured.
- The `send_test_email` management command now shows the full SMTP
  conversation on failure.
- Provided a `change_password` management command which takes a
  `--realm` option.
- Fixed `upgrade-zulip-from-git` crashing in CSS source map generation
  on 1-CPU systems.
- Added an `auto_signup` field in SAML configuration to auto-create
  accounts upon first login attempt by users which are authenticated
  by SAML.
- Provided better error messages when `puppet_classes` in `zulip.conf`
  are mistakenly space-separated instead of comma-separated.
- Updated translations for many languages.

### Zulip Server 4.3

_Released 2021-06-02_

- Fixed exception when upgrading older servers with the
  `JITSI_SERVER_URL` setting set to `None` to disable Jitsi.
- Fixed GIPHY integration dropdown appearing when the server
  doesn't have a GIPHY API key configured.
- The GIPHY API library is no longer loaded for users who are not
  actively using the GIPHY integration.
- Improved formatting for Grafana integration.
- Fixed previews of Dropbox image links.
- Fixed support for storing avatars/emoji in non-S3 upload backends.
- Fixed an overly strict database constraint for code playgrounds.
- Tagged user status strings for translation.
- Updated translation data from Transifex.

### Zulip Server 4.2

_Released 2021-05-13_

- Fixed exception in purge-old-deployments when upgrading on
  a system that has never upgraded using Git.
- Fixed installation from a directory readable only by root.

### Zulip Server 4.1

_Released 2021-05-13_

- Fixed exception upgrading to the 4.x series from older releases.

### Zulip Server 4.0

_Released 2021-05-13_

#### Highlights

- Code blocks now have a copy-to-clipboard button and can be
  integrated with external code playgrounds, making it convenient to
  work with code while discussing it in Zulip.
- Added a new organization [Moderator role][roles-and-permissions].
  Many permissions settings for sensitive features now support only
  allowing moderators and above to use the feature.
- Added a native Giphy integration for sending animated GIFs.
- Added support for muting another user.
- "Recent topics" is no longer beta, no longer an overlay, supports
  composing messages, and is now the default view. The previous
  default view, "All messages", is still available, and the default
  view can now be configured via "Display settings".
- Completed API documentation for Zulip's real-time events system. It
  is now possible to write a decent Zulip client with minimal
  interaction with the Zulip server development team.
- Added new organization settings: wildcard mention policy.
- Integrated [Smokescreen][smokescreen], an outgoing proxy designed to
  help protect against SSRF attacks; outgoing HTTP requests that can
  be triggered by end users are routed through this service.
  We recommend that self-hosted installations configure it.
- This release contains more than 30 independent changes to the [Zulip
  API](https://zulip.com/api/changelog), largely to support new
  features or make the API (and thus its documentation) clearer and
  easier for clients to implement. Other new API features support
  better error handling for the mobile and terminal apps.
- The frontend internationalization library was switched from i18next
  to FormatJS.
- The button for replying was redesigned to show the reply recipient
  and be more obvious to users coming from other chat apps.
- Added support for moving topics to private streams, and for configuring
  which roles can move topics between streams.

[roles-and-permissions]: https://zulip.com/help/roles-and-permissions

#### Upgrade notes for 4.0

- Changed the Tornado service to use 127.0.0.1:9800 instead of
  127.0.0.1:9993 as its default network address, to simplify support
  for multiple Tornado processes. Since Tornado only listens on
  localhost, this change should have no visible effect unless another
  service is using port 9800.
- Zulip's top-level puppet classes have been renamed, largely from
  `zulip::foo` to `zulip::profile::foo`. Configuration referencing
  these `/etc/zulip/zulip.conf` will be automatically updated during
  the upgrade process, but if you have a complex deployment or you
  maintain `zulip.conf` is another system (E.g. with the [manual
  configuration][docker-zulip-manual] option for
  [docker-zulip][docker-zulip]), you'll want to manually update the
  `puppet_classes` variable.
- Zulip's supervisord configuration now lives in `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/zulip/`
- Consider enabling [Smokescreen][smokescreen]
- Private streams can no longer be default streams (i.e. the ones new
  users are automatically added to).
- New `scripts/start-server` and `scripts/stop-server` mean that
  one no longer needs to use `supervisorctl` directly for these tasks.
- As this is a major release, we recommend [carefully updating the
  inline documentation in your
  `/etc/zulip/settings.py`][update-settings-docs]. Notably, we rewrote the
  template to be better organized and more readable in this release.
- The web app will now display a warning in the UI if the Zulip server
  has not been upgraded in more than 18 months.
  template to be better organized and more readable.
- The next time users log in to Zulip with their password after
  upgrading to this release, they will be logged out of all active
  browser sessions (i.e. the web and desktop apps). This is a side
  effect of improved security settings (increasing the minimum entropy
  used when salting passwords from 71 bits to 128 bits).
- We've removed the partial Thumbor integration from Zulip. The
  Thumbor project appears to be dead upstream, and we no longer feel
  comfortable including it in Zulip from a security perspective. We
  hope to introduce a fully supported thumbnailing integration in our next
  major release.

## Zulip Server 3.x series

### Zulip Server 3.4

_Released 2021-04-14_

- CVE-2021-30487: Prevent administrators from moving topics to
  disallowed streams.
- CVE-2021-30479: Prevent guest user access to `all_public_streams`
  API.
- CVE-2021-30478: Prevent API super users from forging messages to
  other organizations.
- CVE-2021-30477: Prevent outgoing webhook bots from sending arbitrary
  messages to any stream.
- Fixed a potential HTML injection bug in outgoing emails.
- Fixed Postfix configuration error which would prevent outgoing email
  to any email address containing `.`, `+`, or starting with `mm`, when
  configured to use the local Postfix to deliver outgoing email.
- Fixed a backporting error which caused the
  `manage.py change_user_role` tool to not work for `admin`, `member`,
  or `guest` roles.
- Add support for logout events sent from modern versions of the
  desktop application.
- Upgraded minor python dependencies.
- Minor documentation fixes.

### Zulip Server 3.3

_Released 2020-12-01_

- Guest users should not be allowed to post to streams marked “Only
  organization full members can post.” This flaw has existed since
  the feature was added in Zulip Server 3.0.
- Permit outgoing mail from postfix; this resolves a bug introduced in
  Zulip Server 3.2 which prevented Zulip from sending outgoing mail if
  the local mail server (used mostly for incoming mail) was also used
  for outgoing email (`MAIL_HOST='localhost'`).
- Ensure that the `upgrade-postgres` tool upgrades the cluster’s data
  to the specific PostgreSQL version requested; this resolves a bug
  where, now that PostgreSQL 13 has been released, `upgrade-postgres`
  would attempt to upgrade to that version and not PostgreSQL 12.
- Replace the impenetrably-named `./manage.py knight` with
  `./manage.py change_user_role`, and extend it to support
  “Organization owner” roles.
- Handle realm emojis that have been manually deleted more gracefully.

### Zulip Server 3.2

_Released 2020-09-15_

- Switched from `libmemcached` to `python-binary-memcached`, a
  pure-Python implementation; this should eliminate memcached
  connection problems affecting some installations.
- Removed unnecessary `django-cookies-samesite` dependency, which had
  its latest release removed from PyPI (breaking installation of Zulip
  3.1).
- Limited which local email addresses Postfix accepts when the
  incoming email integration is enabled; this prevents the enumeration
  of local users via the email system.
- Fixed incorrectly case-sensitive email validation in `REMOTE_USER`
  authentication.
- Fixed search results for `has:image`.
- Fixed ability to adjust "Who can post on the stream" configuration.
- Fixed display of "Permission [to post] will be granted in n days"
  for n > 365.
- Support providing `nginx_listen_port` setting in conjunction with
  `http_only` in `zulip.conf`.
- Improved upgrade documentation.
- Removed internal ID lists which could leak into the events API.

### Zulip Server 3.1

_Released 2020-07-30_

- Removed unused `short_name` field from the User model. This field
  had no purpose and could leak the local part of email addresses
  when email address visibility was restricted.
- Fixed a bug where loading spinners would sometimes not be displayed.
- Fixed incoming email gateway exception with unstructured headers.
- Fixed AlertWords not being included in data import/export.
- Fixed Twitter previews not including a clear link to the tweet.
- Fixed compose box incorrectly opening after uploading a file in a
  message edit widget.
- Fixed exception in SAML integration with encrypted assertions.
- Fixed an analytics migration bug that could cause upgrading from 2.x
  releases to fail.
- Added a Thinkst Canary integration (and renamed the old one, which
  was actually an integration for canarytokens.org).
- Reformatted the frontend codebase using prettier. This change was
  included in this maintenance release to ensure backporting patches
  from `main` remains easy.

### Zulip Server 3.0

_Released 2020-07-16_

#### Highlights

- Added support for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal. This release drops support
  for Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and Debian 9 Stretch.
- Redesigned the top navbar/search area to be much cleaner and show
  useful data like subscriber counts and stream descriptions in
  default views.
- Added a new "Recent topics" widget, which lets one browse recent
  and ongoing conversations at a glance. We expect this widget to
  replace "All messages" as the default view in Zulip in the
  next major release.
- Redesigned "Notification settings" to have an intuitive table
  format and display any individual streams with non-default settings.
- Added support for moving topics between streams. This was by far
  Zulip's most-requested feature.
- Added automatic theme detection using prefers-color-scheme.
- Added support for GitLab and Sign in with Apple authentication.
- Added an organization setting controlling who can use private messages.
- Added support for default stream groups, which allow organizations
  to offer options of sets of streams when new users sign up.
  Currently can only be managed via the Zulip API.
- The Zulip server now sets badge counts for the iOS mobile app.
- Quote-and-reply now generates a handy link to the quoted message.
- Upgraded Django from 1.11.x to the latest LTS series, 2.2.x.
- Added integrations for ErrBit, Grafana, Thinkst Canary, and Alertmanager.
- Extended API documentation to have detailed data on most responses,
  validated against the API's actual implementation and against all
  tests in our extensive automated test suite.
- Added support for programmable message retention policies, both a
  global/default policy and policies for specific streams.
- Added a new incoming webhook API that accepts messages in the format
  used by Slack's incoming webhooks API.
- Introduced the Zulip API feature level, a concept that will greatly
  simplify the implementation of mobile, terminal, and desktop clients
  that need to talk to a wide range of supported Zulip server
  versions, as well as the [Zulip API
  changelog](https://zulip.com/api/changelog).
- Our primary official domain is now zulip.com, not zulipchat.com.

#### Upgrade notes for 3.0

- Logged in users will be logged out during this one-time upgrade to
  transition them to more secure session cookies.
- This release contains dozens of database migrations, but we don't
  anticipate any of them being particularly expensive compared to
  those in past major releases.
- Previous versions had a rare bug that made it possible to create two
  user accounts with the same email address, preventing either from
  logging in. A migration in this release adds a database constraint
  that will fix this bug. The new migration will fail if any such
  duplicate accounts already exist; you can check whether this will
  happen be running the following in a [management shell][manage-shell]:
  ```python
  from django.db.models.functions import Lower
  UserProfile.objects.all().annotate(email_lower=Lower("delivery_email"))
      .values('realm_id', 'email_lower').annotate(Count('id')).filter(id__count__gte=2)
  ```
  If the command returns any accounts, you need to address the
  duplicate accounts before upgrading. Zulip Cloud only had two
  accounts affected by this bug, so we expect the vast majority of
  installations will have none.
- This release switches Zulip to install PostgreSQL 12 from the upstream
  PostgreSQL repository by default, rather than using the default
  PostgreSQL version included with the operating system. Existing Zulip
  installations will continue to work with PostgreSQL 10; this detail is
  configured in `/etc/zulip/zulip.conf`. We have no concrete plans to
  start requiring PostgreSQL 12, though we do expect it to improve
  performance. Installations that would like to upgrade can follow
  [our new PostgreSQL upgrade guide][postgresql-upgrade].
- The format of the `JWT_AUTH_KEYS` setting has changed to include an
  [algorithms](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms.html)
  list: `{"subdomain": "key"}` becomes
  `{"subdomain": {"key": "key", "algorithms": ["HS256"]}}`.

  configuration where `AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH` is newly
  required, but is not yet set.
- Reimplemented `--postgres-missing-dictionaries` installer option,
  used with our new support for a DBaaS managed database.
- Improved documentation for `AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH`.

### Zulip Server 2.1.0

_Released 2019-12-12_

#### Highlights

- Added support for Debian 10. Removed support for EOL Ubuntu 14.04.
- Added support for SAML authentication.
- Removed our dependency on `tsearch_extras`, making it possible to
  run a production Zulip server against any PostgreSQL database
  (including those where one cannot install extensions, like Amazon RDS).
- Significantly improved the email->Zulip gateway, and added [nice
  setup documentation](../production/email-gateway.md). It now
  should be possible to subscribe a Zulip stream to an email list and
  have a good experience.
- Added an option for hiding access to user email addresses from
  other users. While counterproductive for most corporate
  communities, for open source projects and other volunteer
  organizations, this can be a critical anti-spam feature.
- Added a new setting controlling which unread messages are counted in
  the favicon, title, and desktop app.
- Support for showing inline previews of linked webpages has moved
  from alpha to beta. See the upgrade notes below for some changes in
  how it is configured.
- Added support for importing an organization from Mattermost (similar
  to existing Slack/HipChat/Gitter import tools). Slack import now
  supports importing data only included in corporate exports,
  including private messages and shared channels.
- Added Markdown support and typeahead for mentioning topics.
- Email notifications have been completely redesigned with a minimal,
  readable style inspired by GitHub's email notifications.
- We merged significant preparatory work for supporting RHEL/CentOS in
  production. We're now interested in beta testers for this feature.
- Reorganized Zulip's documentation for sysadmins, and added [new
  documentation](../production/modify.md)
  on maintaining a fork of Zulip.
- Added new `streams:public` search operator that searches the public
  history of all streams in the organization (even before you joined).
- Added support for sending email and mobile push notifications for
  wildcard mentions (@all and @everyone). Previously, they only
  triggered desktop notifications; now, that's configurable.

#### Upgrade notes for 2.1.0

- The defaults for Zulip's now beta inline URL preview setting have changed.
  Previously, the server-level `INLINE_URL_EMBED_PREVIEW` setting was
  disabled, and organization-level setting was enabled. Now, the
  server-level setting is enabled by default, and the organization-level
  setting is disabled. As a result, organization administrators can
  configure this feature entirely in the UI. However, servers that had
  previously [enabled previews of linked
  websites](https://zulip.com/help/allow-image-link-previews) will
  lose the setting and need to re-enable it.
- We rewrote the Google authentication backend to use the
  `python-social-auth` system we use for other third-party
  authentication systems. For this release, the old variable names
  still work, but users should update the following setting names in
  their configuration as we will desupport the old names in a future
  release:
  - In `/etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf`, `google_oauth2_client_secret`
    is now called with `social_auth_google_secret`.
  - In `/etc/zulip/settings.py`, `GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` should be
    replaced with `SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_KEY`.
  - In `/etc/zulip/settings.py`, `GoogleMobileOauth2Backend` should
    be replaced with called `GoogleAuthBackend`.
- Installations using Zulip's LDAP integration without
  `LDAP_APPEND_DOMAIN` will need to configure two new settings telling
  Zulip how to look up a user in LDAP given their email address:
  `AUTH_LDAP_REVERSE_EMAIL_SEARCH` and `AUTH_LDAP_USERNAME_ATTR`. See
  the [LDAP configuration
  instructions](../production/authentication-methods.md#ldap-including-active-directory)
  for details. You can use the usual `manage.py query_ldap` method to
  verify whether your configuration is working correctly.
- The Zulip web and desktop apps have been converted to directly count
  all unread messages, replacing an old system that just counted the
  (recent) messages fully fetched by the web app. This one-time
  transition may cause some users to notice old messages that were
  sent months or years ago "just became unread". What actually
  happened is the user never read these messages, and the Zulip web app
  was not displaying that. Generally, the fix is for users to simply
  mark those messages as read as usual.
- Previous versions of Zulip's installer would generate the secrets
  `local_database_password` and `initial_password_salt`. These
  secrets don't do anything, as they only modify behavior of a Zulip
  development environment. We recommend deleting those lines from
  `/etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf` when you upgrade to avoid confusion.
- This release has a particularly expensive database migration,
  changing the `UserMessage.id` field from an `int` to a `bigint` to
  support more than 2 billion message deliveries on a Zulip server.
  It runs in 2 phases: A first migration that doesn't require the
  server to be down (which took about 4 hours to process the 250M rows
  on chat.zulip.org, and a second migration that does require downtime
  (which took about 60 seconds for chat.zulip.org). You can check the
  number of rows for your server with `UserMessage.objects.count()`.

  We expect that most Zulip servers can happily just use the normal
  upgrade process with a few minutes of downtime. Zulip servers with
  over 1M messages may want to first upgrade to [this
  commit](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/b008515d63841e1c0a16ad868d3d67be3bfc20ca)
  using `upgrade-zulip-from-git`, following the instructions to avoid
  downtime, and then upgrade to the new release.

- The HipChat/Stride data import tool is no longer experimental.
  Our HipChat and Slack import tools are now well-tested with millions
  of messages, 10,000s of users, and 100,000s of uploaded files.
- Added a built-in tool for backups and restoration.
- Deprecated support for Ubuntu 14.04. Zulip 2.0.x will continue to
  support Ubuntu 14.04, but Zulip 2.1.0 will remove support for
  installing on Ubuntu 14.04.

#### Upgrade notes for 2.0.0

- This release adds support for submitting basic usage statistics to
  help the Zulip core team. This feature can be enabled only if a server
  is using the [Mobile Push Notification Service][mobile-push],
  and is enabled by default in that case. To disable it, set
  `SUBMIT_USAGE_STATISTICS = False` in `/etc/zulip/settings.py`.

## Zulip Server 1.9.x series

### Zulip Server 1.9.2

_Released 2019-01-29_

This release migrates Zulip off a deprecated Google+ API (necessary
for Google authentication to continue working past March 7), and
contains a few bug fixes for the installer and Slack import. It has
minimal changes for existing servers not using Google authentication.

- Updated the Google auth integration to stop using a deprecated and
  soon-to-be-removed Google+ authentication API.
- Improved installer error messages for common configuration problems.
- Fixed several bugs in Slack, Gitter, and HipChat import tools.
- Fixed a subtle bug in garbage-collection of the node_modules cache.
- Optimized performance of Slack import for organizations with
  thousands of users.

### Zulip Server 1.9.1

_Released 2018-11-30_

This release is primarily intended to improve the experience for new
Zulip installations; it has minimal changes for existing servers.

- Added support for getting multi-domain certificates with setup-certbot.
- Improved various installer error messages and sections of the
  installation documentation to help avoid for common mistakes.
- The Google auth integration now always offers an account chooser.
- Fixed buggy handling of avatars in Slack import.
- Fixed nginx configuration for mobile API authentication to access uploads.
- Updated translation data, including significant new Italian strings.

### Zulip Server 1.9.0

_Released 2018-11-07_

#### Highlights

- Support for Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian 9 (our first non-Ubuntu
  platform!). We expect to deprecate support for installing a new
  Zulip server on Ubuntu 14.04 in the coming months, in preparation
  for Ubuntu 14.04’s end-of-life in April 2019.
- New data import tools for HipChat and Gitter. The Slack importer
  is now out of beta.
- Zulip Python process startup time is about 30% faster; this effort
  resulted in upstream contributions to fix significant performance
  bugs in django-bitfield, libthumbor, and pika.
- You can now configure custom (organization-specific) fields for user
  profiles; Zulip can now serve as your organization’s employee
  directory.
- Zulip now supports using Google Hangouts instead of Jitsi as the
  video chat provider.
- Users can now configure email and mobile push notifications for
  all messages in a stream (useful for low-traffic
  streams/organizations), not just for messages mentioning them.
- New [stream settings](https://zulip.com/help/stream-permissions)
  control whether private stream subscribers can access history
  from before they joined, and allow configuring streams to only
  allow administrators to post.
- Zulip now has experimental support for guest users (intended
  for use cases like contractors who the organization only wants
  to have access to a few streams).
- New native integrations for Ansible Tower, Appveyor, Clubhouse,
  Netlify, and Zabbix; Zulip now has over 100 native integrations (in
  addition to hundreds more available via Zapier and IFTTT).
- New translations for Ukrainian, Portuguese, Indonesian, Dutch, and
  Finnish. Zulip now has complete or nearly-complete translations
  for German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian,
  Czech, Finnish, and Turkish. Partial translations for Chinese,
  Dutch, Korean, Polish, Japanese, and Indonesian cover the majority
  of the total strings in the project.

#### Upgrade notes for 1.9.0

- Zulip 1.9 contains a significant database migration that can take
  several minutes to run. The upgrade process automatically minimizes
  disruption by running this migration first, before beginning the
  user-facing downtime. However, if you'd like to watch the downtime
  phase of the upgrade closely, we recommend
  running them first manually
  as well as the usual trick of doing an apt upgrade first.

#### Full feature changelog

- Added an organization setting for message deletion time limits.
- Added an organization setting to control who can edit topics.
- Added Ctrl+K keyboard shortcut for getting to search (same as /, but
  works even when you're inside compose).

  both GitHub authentication and hosting multiple Zulip organizations
  should set (see [the docs for details](../production/multiple-organizations.md#authentication)).

  security model documentation for details.
- On Ubuntu 16.04, the local uploads backend now does the same security
  checks that the S3 backend did before serving files to users.

  how emoji reactions are used.
- Fixed most of the known (mostly obscure) bugs in how messages are
  formatted in Zulip.

- Fixed numerous issues in the "stream settings" UI.
- Fixed numerous subtle bugs with the stream creation UI.
- Changes the URL scheme for stream narrows to encode the stream ID,
  so that they can be robust to streams being renamed. The change is
  backwards-compatible; existing narrow URLs still work.

#### Upgrade notes for 1.8.0

This major release has no special upgrade notes.

## Zulip Server 1.7.x series

### Zulip Server 1.7.2

_Released 2018-04-12_

This is a security release, with a handful of cherry-picked changes
since 1.7.1. All Zulip server admins are encouraged to upgrade
promptly.

- CVE-2018-9986: Fix XSS issues with frontend Markdown processor.
- CVE-2018-9987: Fix XSS issue with muting notifications.
- CVE-2018-9990: Fix XSS issue with stream names in topic typeahead.
- CVE-2018-9999: Fix XSS issue with user uploads. The fix for this
  adds a Content-Security-Policy for the `LOCAL_UPLOADS_DIR` storage
  backend for user-uploaded files.

Thanks to Suhas Sunil Gaikwad for reporting CVE-2018-9987 and w2w for
reporting CVE-2018-9986 and CVE-2018-9990.

### Zulip Server 1.7.1

_Released 2017-11-21_

This is a security release, with a handful of cherry-picked changes
since 1.7.0. All Zulip server admins are encouraged to upgrade
promptly.

This release includes fixes for the upgrade process, so server admins
running a version from before 1.7 should upgrade directly to 1.7.1.

- CVE-2017-0910: On a server with multiple realms, a vulnerability in
  the invitation system allowed an authorized user of one realm to
  create an account on any other realm.
- The Korean translation is now complete, a huge advance from almost
  nothing in 1.7.0. The French translation is now nearly complete,
  and several other languages have smaller updates.
- The installer now sets LC_ALL to a known locale, working around an
  issue where some dependencies fail to install in some locales.
- We fixed a bug in the script that runs after upgrading Zulip (so
  the fix applies when upgrading to this version), where the
  garbage-collection of old deployments sometimes wouldn't preserve
  the immediate last deployment.

### Zulip Server 1.7.0

_Released 2017-10-25_

#### Highlights

**Web**

- We’ve completely redesigned our onboarding process to explain Zulip,
  and especially topics, to new users.
- We’ve built a beautiful new emoji picker with categories, a
  showcase, and much better data. Note the clean, underscore-free
  display!
- The emails sent by Zulip are more consistent, readable, and visually
  interesting.
- Chinese (Simplified) and Japanese join Spanish, German, and Czech in
  having the user interface fully translated, in addition to partial
  translations for many other languages. We also fixed many small
  issues where strings weren’t tagged for translation.
- Many pages have been redesigned to be easier to use and visually
  cleaner, including the settings pages and the user documentation at
  /help, /integrations, and /apps.

**Mobile and Desktop support**

- Zulip Server 1.7 adds several new APIs that are critical for mobile
  app performance and that let the app track unread messages. If
  you’re using the mobile apps at all (iOS or Android), you will
  definitely want to upgrade to Zulip 1.7.
- The iOS and Android apps can receive push notifications
  (configurable, naturally) for events like PMs and @-mentions. While
  Zulip Server 1.6 has basic support for these, 1.7 brings a new,
  clearer format to notifications, and gives each user more options
  for finer-grained control.
- The new Electron desktop app is out of beta and replaces our legacy
  desktop apps.

**Backend and scaling**

- Zulip now runs exclusively on Python 3. This is the culmination of
  an 18-month migration effort. We are very excited about this!
- We’ve added an automatic "soft deactivation" process, which
  dramatically improves performance for organizations with a large
  number of inactive users, without any impact on those users’
  experience if they later come back.
- Zulip's performance at scale has improved significantly. Performance
  now scales primarily with number of active users (not total
  users). As an example, chat.zulip.org serves 400 monthly active
  users and about 3500 total users, on one VM with just 8GB of RAM and
  a CPU consistently over 90% idle.

#### Upgrade notes for 1.7.0

- Zulip 1.7 contains some significant database migrations that can
  take several minutes to run. The upgrade process automatically
  minimizes disruption by running these first, before beginning the
  user-facing downtime. However, if you'd like to watch the downtime
  phase of the upgrade closely, we recommend
  running them first manually
  as well as the usual trick of doing an apt upgrade first.

- We've removed support for an uncommon legacy deployment model where
  a Zulip server served multiple organizations on the same domain.
  Installs with multiple organizations now require each organization
  to have its own subdomain.

  This change should have no effect for the vast majority of Zulip
  servers that only have one organization. If you manage a server
  that hosts multiple organizations, you'll want to read [our guide on
  multiple organizations](../production/multiple-organizations.md).

- We simplified the configuration for our password strength checker to
  be much more intuitive. If you were using the
  `PASSWORD_MIN_ZXCVBN_QUALITY` setting,
  [it has been replaced](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/a116303604e362796afa54b5d923ea5312b2ea23) by
  the more intuitive `PASSWORD_MIN_GUESSES`.
